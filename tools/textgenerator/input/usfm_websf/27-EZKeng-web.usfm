\c 1  
\p
\v 1 Now in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth of the month, as I was among the captives by the river
Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.\f + The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים”
(Elohim).\f* 
\p
\v 2 In the fifth of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,
\v 3 Yahweh’s\f + “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other
translations.\f* word came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar;
and Yahweh’s hand was there on him. 
\p
\v 4 I looked, and behold,\f + “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used
as an interjection.\f* a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness around it,
and out of the middle of it as it were glowing metal, out of the middle of the fire.
\v 5 Out of its center came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.
\v 6 Everyone had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.
\v 7 Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like
burnished brass. 
\v 8 They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and the four of them had their faces and their wings
thus: 
\v 9 their wings were joined to one another; they didn’t turn when they went; each one went straight forward.
\p
\v 10 As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and the four of them had the face of a lion on the right
side; and the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side; the four of them also had the face of an eagle.
\v 11 Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above. Two wings of each one touched another, and two covered their
bodies. 
\v 12 Each one went straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; they didn’t turn when they went.
\v 13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of
torches: the fire went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and lightning went out of the fire.
\v 14 The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
\p
\v 15 Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces
of it. 
\v 16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl: and the four of them had one likeness; and their appearance
and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. 
\v 17 When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn’t turn when they went.
\v 18 As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and the four of them had their rims full of eyes all around.
\p
\v 19 When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth,
the wheels were lifted up. 
\v 20 Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the
spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 
\v 21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels
were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\p
\v 22 Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like the awesome crystal to look on, stretched
out over their heads above. 
\v 23 Under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: each one had two which covered on this side, and
every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies. 
\v 24 When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise
of tumult like the noise of an army: when they stood, they let down their wings.
\p
\v 25 There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.
\v 26 Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a
sapphire\f + or, lapis lazuli\f* stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it
above. 
\v 27 I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it all around, from the appearance of his waist and
upward; and from the appearance of his waist and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness
around him. 
\v 28 As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all
around. 
\p This was the appearance of the likeness of Yahweh’s glory. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that
spoke. 
\c 2  
\p
\v 1 He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.”
\v 2 The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.
\p
\v 3 He said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They
and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.
\v 4 The children are impudent and stiff-hearted. I am sending you to them, and you shall tell them, ‘Thus says the
Lord\f + The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”\f* Yahweh.’ 
\v 5 They, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there
has been a prophet among them. 
\v 6 You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you
do dwell among scorpions. Don’t be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
\v 7 You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.
\v 8 But you, son of man, hear what I tell you. Don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth, and eat that
which I give you.” 
\p
\v 9 When I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me; and, behold, a scroll of a book was therein;
\v 10 He spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning,
and woe. 
\b
\c 3  
\p
\v 1 He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”
\p
\v 2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the scroll. 
\p
\v 3 He said to me, “Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you.”
\p Then I ate it; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. 
\p
\v 4 He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.
\v 5 For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;
\v 6 not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, if I sent you
to them, they would listen to you. 
\v 7 But the house of Israel will not listen to you, for they will not listen to me; for all the house of Israel are
obstinate\f + Literally, have a hard forehead\f* and hard-hearted.
\v 8 Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.
\v 9 I have made your forehead as a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them, neither be dismayed at their looks,
though they are a rebellious house.” 
\p
\v 10 Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your
ears. 
\v 11 Go to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord
Yahweh;’ whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. 
\p
\v 12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, “Blessed be Yahweh’s glory from
his place.” 
\v 13 I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside
them, even the noise of a great rushing. 
\v 14 So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and Yahweh’s hand was
strong on me. 
\v 15 Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat
there overwhelmed among them seven days. 
\p
\v 16 At the end of seven days, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 17 “Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from
me. 
\v 18 When I tell the wicked, ‘You will surely die;’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked
way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but I will require his blood at your hand.
\v 19 Yet if you warn the wicked, and he doesn’t turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his
iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.” 
\p
\v 20 “Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him,
he shall die. Because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall
not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand. 
\v 21 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live,
because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.” 
\p
\v 22 Yahweh’s hand was there on me; and he said to me, “Arise, go out into the plain, and I will talk with you there.”
\p
\v 23 Then I arose, and went out into the plain: and behold, Yahweh’s glory stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river
Chebar; and I fell on my face. 
\p
\v 24 Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet. He spoke with me, and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your
house. 
\v 25 But you, son of man, behold, they will put ropes on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them.
\v 26 I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you will be mute, and will not be to them a reprover; for
they are a rebellious house. 
\v 27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh.’ He who hears,
let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.”
\c 4  
\p
\v 1 “You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before yourself, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem.
\v 2 Lay siege against it, build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it. Also set camps against it and plant
battering rams against it all around. 
\v 3 Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face toward it. It
shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
\p
\v 4 “Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. According to the number of the days
that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity. 
\v 5 For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days: so you
shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
\p
\v 6 “Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of
Judah. I have appointed forty days, each day for a year, to you.
\v 7 You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it.
\v 8 Behold, I put ropes on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the
days of your siege. 
\p
\v 9 “Take for yourself also wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel. Make bread of it.
According to the number of the days that you shall lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, you shall eat of it.
\v 10 Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels\f + A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35
ounces.\f* a day. From time to time you shall eat it. 
\v 11 You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin. From time to time you shall drink.
\v 12 You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.”
\v 13 Yahweh said, “Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.”
\p
\v 14 Then I said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now I have not eaten
of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals; neither came there abominable meat into my mouth!”
\p
\v 15 Then he said to me, “Behold, I have given you cow’s dung for man’s dung, and you shall prepare your bread on it.”
\p
\v 16 Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They will eat bread by weight,
and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay;
\v 17 that they may lack bread and water, be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.
\c 5  
\p
\v 1 “You, son of man, take a sharp sword. You shall take it as a barber’s razor to yourself, and shall cause it to pass over
your head and over your beard. Then take balances to weigh and divide the hair.
\v 2 A third part you shall burn in the fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled. You shall
take a third part, and strike with the sword around it. A third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword
after them. 
\v 3 You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in your skirts.
\v 4 Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire; from it shall a fire
come out into all the house of Israel. 
\p
\v 5 “Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, and countries are around her.
\v 6 She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the
countries that are around her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.’
\p
\v 7 “Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because you are turbulent more than the nations that are around you, and have not
walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have done after the ordinances of the nations that are around
you; 
\v 8 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments among you in the
sight of the nations. 
\v 9 I will do in you that which I have not done, and which I will not do any more the like, because of all your abominations.
\v 10 Therefore the fathers will eat the sons within you, and the sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments on you;
and I will scatter the whole remnant of you to all the winds. 
\v 11 Therefore as I live,’ says the Lord Yahweh, ‘surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable
things, and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you. My eye won’t spare, and I will have no pity.
\v 12 A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed within you. A third part will
fall by the sword around you. A third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.
\p
\v 13 “‘Thus my anger will be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I will be comforted. They will
know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them.
\p
\v 14 “‘Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you, in the sight of all that
pass by. 
\v 15 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are around you, when I
shall execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes—I, Yahweh, have spoken it—
\v 16 when I send on them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. I will increase
the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread. 
\v 17 I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood will pass through you; and I
will bring the sword on you. I, Yahweh, have spoken it.’” 
\c 6  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them,
\v 3 and say, ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and to the
hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: “Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high
places. 
\v 4 Your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be broken. I will cast down your slain men before your
idols. 
\v 5 I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars.
\v 6 In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be
laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down, and your works
may be abolished. 
\v 7 The slain shall fall among you, and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 8 “‘“Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you will have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered
through the countries. 
\v 9 Those of you that escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken with
their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols. Then they will
loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
\v 10 They will know that I am Yahweh. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.”’
\p
\v 11 “Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas!” Because of all the evil
abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\v 12 He who is far off will die of the pestilence. He who is near will fall by the sword. He who remains and is besieged will
die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath on them. 
\v 13 You will know that I am Yahweh, when their slain men are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on
all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered pleasant aroma
to all their idols. 
\v 14 I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout
all their habitations: and they will know that I am Yahweh. ’” 
\b
\c 7  
\p
\v 1 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “You, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel, ‘An end! The end has come on the four corners of the
land. 
\v 3 Now is the end on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways. I will bring on you all
your abominations. 
\v 4 My eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations will be
among you. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.’ 
\p
\v 5 “Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘An evil! A unique evil! Behold, it comes.
\v 6 An end has come. The end has come! It awakes against you. Behold, it comes.
\v 7 Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land! The time has come! The day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful
shouting, on the mountains. 
\v 8 Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your
ways. I will bring on you all your abominations. 
\v 9 My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. I will bring on you according to your ways. Your abominations will be among
you; and you will know that I, Yahweh, strike. 
\p
\v 10 “‘Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed. Pride has budded.
\v 11 Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them will remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth.
There shall be nothing of value among them. 
\v 12 The time has come! The day draws near. Don’t let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all its
multitude. 
\v 13 For the seller won’t return to that which is sold, although they are still alive; for the vision concerns the whole
multitude of it. None shall return; neither will any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
\v 14 They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but no one goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all its
multitude. 
\p
\v 15 “‘The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within. He who is in the field will die by the sword. He who is
in the city will be devoured by famine and pestilence. 
\v 16 But those of those who escape will escape, and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning,
everyone in his iniquity. 
\v 17 All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water.
\v 18 They will also clothe themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them. Shame will be on all faces, and baldness on
all their heads. 
\v 19 They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold shall
not be able to deliver them in the day of Yahweh’s wrath. They won’t satisfy their souls, neither fill their bellies; because
it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity. 
\v 20 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their
detestable things therein. Therefore I have made it to them as an unclean thing.
\v 21 I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a plunder; and they will
profane it. 
\v 22 I will also turn my face from them, and they will profane my secret place. Robbers will enter into it, and profane it.
\p
\v 23 “‘Make chains; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
\v 24 Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. I will also make the pride of the
strong to cease. Their holy places will be profaned. 
\v 25 Destruction comes! They will seek peace, and there will be none.
\v 26 Mischief will come on mischief, and rumor will be on rumor. They will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will
perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders. 
\v 27 The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation. The hands of the people of the land will be
troubled. I will do to them after their way, and according to their own judgments will I judge them; and they shall know that I
am Yahweh.’” 
\c 8  
\p
\v 1 In the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat
before me, the Lord Yahweh’s hand fell there on me. 
\v 2 Then I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his waist and downward, fire; and
from his waist and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.
\v 3 He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the
sky, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward the north;
where there was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.
\v 4 Behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.
\p
\v 5 Then he said to me, “Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north.”
\p So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and saw, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the
entry. 
\p
\v 6 He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they do? Even the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here,
that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you will again see yet other great abominations.”
\p
\v 7 He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
\v 8 Then he said to me, “Son of man, dig now in the wall.” 
\p When I had dug in the wall, I saw a door. 
\p
\v 9 He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.”
\p
\v 10 So I went in and looked, and saw every form of creeping things, abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of
Israel, portrayed around on the wall. 
\v 11 Seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel stood before them. In the middle of them Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan
stood, every man with his censer in his hand; and the smell of the cloud of incense went up.
\p
\v 12 Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his
rooms of imagery? For they say, ‘Yahweh doesn’t see us. Yahweh has forsaken the land.’”
\v 13 He said also to me, “You will again see more of the great abominations which they do.”
\p
\v 14 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh’s house which was toward the north; and I saw the women sit there
weeping for Tammuz. 
\v 15 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? You will again see yet greater abominations than these.”
\p
\v 16 He brought me into the inner court of Yahweh’s house; and I saw at the door of Yahweh’s temple, between the porch and the
altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs toward Yahweh’s temple, and their faces toward the east; and they were
worshiping the sun toward the east. 
\p
\v 17 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the
abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger.
Behold, they put the branch to their nose. 
\v 18 Therefore will I also deal in wrath. My eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity. Though they cry in my ears with a loud
voice, yet I will not hear them.” 
\c 9  
\p
\v 1 Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, each man with
his destroying weapon in his hand.” 
\v 2 Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in
his hand. One man in the middle of them was clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stood
beside the bronze altar. 
\p
\v 3 The glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and he called to
the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.
\v 4 Yahweh said to him, “Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads
of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done within it.”
\p
\v 5 To the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city after him, and strike. Don’t let your eye spare, neither have
pity. 
\v 6 Kill utterly the old man, the young man, the virgin, little children and women; but don’t come near any man on whom is the
mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” 
\p Then they began at the old men who were before the house. 
\p
\v 7 He said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!”
\p They went out, and struck in the city. 
\v 8 While they were killing, and I was left, I fell on my face, and cried, and said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Will you destroy all the
residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?”
\p
\v 9 Then he said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood,
and the city full of perversion; for they say, ‘Yahweh has forsaken the land, and Yahweh doesn’t see.’
\v 10 As for me also, my eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.”
\p
\v 11 Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, “I have done as you have
commanded me.” 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a
sapphire\f + or, lapis lazuli \f* stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
\v 2 He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both
your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.”
\p He went in as I watched. 
\v 3 Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.
\v 4 Yahweh’s glory mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the
cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh’s glory.
\v 5 The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
\p
\v 6 It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from
between the cherubim,” that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.
\v 7 The cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of
it, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
\v 8 There appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
\p
\v 9 I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another
cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.
\v 10 As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel within a wheel.
\v 11 When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn’t turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked
they followed it; they didn’t turn as they went. 
\v 12 Their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even
the wheels that the four of them had. 
\v 13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “the whirling wheels”.
\v 14 Every one them had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub. The second face was the face of a man. The
third face was the face of a lion. The fourth was the face of an eagle.
\p
\v 15 The cherubim mounted up: this is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.
\v 16 When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the
earth, the wheels also didn’t turn from beside them. 
\v 17 When they stood, these stood; and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them: for the spirit of the living creature
was in them. 
\p
\v 18 Yahweh’s glory went out from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.
\v 19 The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out, and the wheels beside
them: and they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
\p
\v 20 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.
\v 21 Every one had four faces, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
\v 22 As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and
themselves; they went every one straight forward. 
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of Yahweh’s house, which looks eastward: and see, at the
door of the gate twenty-five men; and I saw among them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of
the people. 
\v 2 He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city;
\v 3 who say, ‘The time is not near to build houses. This is the cauldron, and we are the meat.’
\v 4 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.” 
\p
\v 5 Yahweh’s Spirit fell on me, and he said to me, “Speak, ‘Yahweh says: “Thus you have said, house of Israel; for I know the
things that come into your mind. 
\v 6 You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.
\p
\v 7 “‘Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Your slain whom you have laid in the middle of it, they are the meat, and this is
the cauldron; but you will be brought out of the middle of it. 
\v 8 You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword on you,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 9 “I will bring you out of the middle of it, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among
you. 
\v 10 You will fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel; and you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 11 This will not be your cauldron, neither will you be the meat in the middle of it. I will judge you in the border of
Israel. 
\v 12 You will know that I am Yahweh, for you have not walked in my statutes, neither have you executed my ordinances, but have
done after the ordinances of the nations that are around you.”’”
\p
\v 13 When I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said,
“Ah Lord Yahweh! will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?”
\p
\v 14 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 15 “Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your relatives, and all the house of Israel, all of them, to
whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Go far away from Yahweh. This land has been given to us for a possession.’”
\p
\v 16 “Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have
scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have
come.”’ 
\p
\v 17 “Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries
where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.”
\p
\v 18 “‘They will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there.
\v 19 I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and
will give them a heart of flesh; 
\v 20 that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. They will be my people, and I will be their God.
\v 21 But as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their
way on their own heads,’ says the Lord Yahweh.” 
\p
\v 22 Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over
them above. 
\v 23 Yahweh’s glory went up from the middle of the city, and stood on the mountain which is on the east side of the city.
\v 24 The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.
\p So the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
\v 25 Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that Yahweh had shown me.
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word also came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, you dwell in the middle of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see, and don’t see, who have ears to hear,
and don’t hear; for they are a rebellious house. 
\p
\v 3 “Therefore, you son of man, prepare your stuff for moving, and move by day in their sight. You shall move from your place
to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.
\v 4 You shall bring out your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving; and you shall go out yourself at evening in
their sight, as when men go out into exile. 
\v 5 Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your stuff out that way.
\v 6 In their sight you shall bear it on your shoulder, and carry it out in the dark. You shall cover your face, so that you
don’t see the land, for I have set you for a sign to the house of Israel.”
\p
\v 7 I did so as I was commanded. I brought out my stuff by day, as stuff for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall
with my hand. I brought it out in the dark, and bore it on my shoulder in their sight.
\p
\v 8 In the morning, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 9 “Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’
\p
\v 10 “Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel
among whom they are.”’ 
\p
\v 11 “Say, ‘I am your sign. As I have done, so will it be done to them. They will go into exile, into captivity.
\p
\v 12 “‘The prince who is among them will bear on his shoulder in the dark, and will go out. They will dig through the wall to
carry out that way. He will cover his face, because he will not see the land with his eyes.
\v 13 I will also spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the
Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there. 
\v 14 I will scatter toward every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his bands. I will draw out the sword after
them. 
\p
\v 15 “‘They shall know that I am Yahweh, when I shall disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries.
\v 16 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence, that they may declare all
their abominations among the nations where they come; and they will know that I am Yahweh.’”
\p
\v 17 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 18 “Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and with fearfulness.
\v 19 Tell the people of the land, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel:
“They will eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate, and all that is
therein, because of the violence of all those who dwell therein.
\v 20 The cities that are inhabited will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation; then you will know that I am
Yahweh.”’” 
\p
\v 21 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 22 “Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are prolonged, and every vision
fails?’ 
\v 23 Tell them therefore, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a
proverb in Israel;”’ but tell them, ‘“The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.
\v 24 For there will be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
\v 25 For I am Yahweh. I will speak, and the word that I speak will be performed. It will be no more deferred; for in your
days, rebellious house, I will speak the word, and will perform it,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”
\p
\v 26 Again Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 27 “Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, ‘The vision that he sees is for many day to come, and he prophesies
of times that are far off.’ 
\p
\v 28 “Therefore tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “None of my words shall be deferred any more, but the word which I
speak will be performed,” says the Lord Yahweh.’” 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart,
‘Hear Yahweh’s word: 
\v 3 Thus says the Lord Yahweh, “Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
\v 4 Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.
\v 5 You have not gone up into the gaps, neither built up the wall for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day
of Yahweh. 
\v 6 They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say, ‘Yahweh says;’ but Yahweh has not sent them. They have made men to
hope that the word would be confirmed. 
\v 7 Haven’t you seen a false vision, and haven’t you spoken a lying divination, in that you say, ‘Yahweh says;’ but I have not
spoken?” 
\p
\v 8 “‘Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Because you have spoken falsehood and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against
you,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 9 “My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and who divine lies. They will not be in the council of my
people, neither will they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither will they enter into the land of Israel.
Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh” 
\p
\v 10 “‘Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, “Peace;” and there is no peace. When one builds up a wall,
behold, they plaster it with whitewash. 
\v 11 Tell those who plaster it with whitewash that it will fall. There will be an overflowing shower; and you, great
hailstones, will fall. A stormy wind will tear it. 
\v 12 Behold, when the wall has fallen, won’t it be said to you, “Where is the plaster with which you have plastered it?”
\p
\v 13 “‘Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “I will even tear it with a stormy wind in my wrath. There shall be an overflowing
shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.
\v 14 So will I break down the wall that you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its
foundation will be uncovered. It will fall, and you will be consumed in the middle of it. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.
\v 15 Thus will I accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on those who have plastered it with whitewash; and I will tell you, ‘The
wall is no more, neither those who plastered it; 
\v 16 to wit, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no
peace,’” says the Lord Yahweh.’” 
\p
\v 17 You, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy
against them, 
\v 18 and say, “Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Woe to the women who sew pillows on all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of
persons of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?
\v 19 You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls who should not
die, and to save the souls alive who should not live, by your lying to my people who listen to lies.’
\p
\v 20 “Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Behold, I am against your pillows, with which you hunt the souls to make them fly,
and I will tear them from your arms. I will let the souls go, even the souls whom you hunt to make them fly.
\v 21 I will also tear your kerchiefs, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they will be no more in your hand to be
hunted. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. 
\v 22 Because with lies you have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of
the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive.
\v 23 Therefore you shall no more see false visions, nor practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. Then
you will know that I am Yahweh.’” 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me, and sat before me.
\v 2 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 3 “Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their
face. Should I be inquired of at all by them? 
\v 4 Therefore speak to them, and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols
into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I Yahweh will answer
him therein according to the multitude of his idols; 
\v 5 that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.”’
\p
\v 6 “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Return, and turn yourselves from your idols! Turn away
your faces from all your abominations. 
\p
\v 7 “‘“For everyone of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live in Israel, who separates himself from me, and takes
his idols into his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire for
himself of me; I Yahweh will answer him by myself. 
\v 8 I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off
from among my people; and you will know that I am Yahweh. 
\p
\v 9 “‘“If the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I, Yahweh, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand on
him, and will destroy him from among my people Israel. 
\v 10 They will bear their iniquity. The iniquity of the prophet will be even as the iniquity of him who seeks him;
\v 11 that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions;
but that they may be my people, and I may be their God,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”
\p
\v 12 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 13 “Son of man, when a land sins against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out my hand on it, and break the staff
of its bread, and send famine on it, and cut off from it man and animal;
\v 14 though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver only their own souls by their
righteousness,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 15 “If I cause evil animals to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it is made desolate, so that no man may pass
through because of the animals; 
\v 16 though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters. They
only would be delivered, but the land would be desolate. 
\p
\v 17 “Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, ‘Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and animal;’
\v 18 though these three men were in it, as I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but
they only would be delivered themselves. 
\p
\v 19 “Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath on it in blood, to cut off from it man and animal;
\v 20 though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “they would deliver neither son nor daughter;
they would deliver only their own souls by their righteousness.”
\p
\v 21 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “How much more when I send my four severe judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the
famine, and the evil animals, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and animal!
\v 22 Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried out, both sons and daughters. Behold, they shall come
out to you, and you shall see their way and their doings; and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on
Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it. 
\v 23 They will comfort you, when you see their way and their doings; and you will know that I have not done without cause all
that I have done in it,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?
\v 3 Will wood be taken of it to make anything? Will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel on it?
\v 4 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and the middle of it is burned. Is it
profitable for any work? 
\v 5 Behold, when it was whole, it was suitable for no work. How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned,
will it yet be suitable for any work?” 
\p
\v 6 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for
fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
\v 7 I will set my face against them. They will go out from the fire, but the fire will devour them; and you will know that I
am Yahweh, when I set my face against them. 
\v 8 I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 Again Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations; 
\v 3 and say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Jerusalem: “Your origin and your birth is of the land of the Canaanite. An Amorite
was your father, and your mother was a Hittite. 
\v 4 As for your birth, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, neither were you washed in water to cleanse you. You
weren’t salted at all, nor swaddled at all. 
\v 5 No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field,
because you were abhorred in the day that you were born. 
\p
\v 6 “‘“When I passed by you, and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ Yes, I
said to you, ‘Though you are in your blood, live!’ 
\v 7 I caused you to multiply as that which grows in the field, and you increased and grew great, and you attained to excellent
ornament. Your breasts were formed, and your hair grew; yet you were naked and bare.
\p
\v 8 “‘“Now when I passed by you, and looked at you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you,
and covered your nakedness: yes, I swore to you, and entered into a covenant with you,” says the Lord Yahweh, “and you became
mine. 
\p
\v 9 “‘“Then washed I you with water. Yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.
\v 10 I clothed you also with embroidered work, and put sealskin shoes on you. I dressed you with fine linen and covered you
with silk. 
\v 11 I decked you with ornaments. put bracelets on your hands, and a chain on your neck.
\v 12 I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.
\v 13 Thus you were decked with gold and silver. Your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered work. You ate fine
flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and you prospered to royal estate.
\v 14 Your renown went out among the nations for your beauty; for it was perfect, through my majesty which I had put on you,”
says the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 15 “‘“But you trusted in your beauty, and played the prostitute because of your renown, and poured out your prostitution on
everyone who passed by. It was his. 
\v 16 You took some of your garments, and made for yourselves high places decked with various colors, and played the prostitute
on them. This shall not come, neither shall it be. 
\v 17 You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of
men, and played the prostitute with them. 
\v 18 You took your embroidered garments, covered them, and set my oil and my incense before them.
\v 19 My bread also which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey, with which I fed you, you even set it before them for a
pleasant aroma; and so it was,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 20 “‘“Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and you have sacrificed these to them
to be devoured. Was your prostitution a small matter, 
\v 21 that you have slain my children, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through the fire to them?
\v 22 In all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and
bare, and were wallowing in your blood. 
\p
\v 23 “‘“It has happened after all your wickedness. Woe, woe to you!” says the Lord Yahweh,
\v 24 “that you have built for yourselves a vaulted place, and have made yourselves a lofty place in every street.
\v 25 You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and have made your beauty an abomination, and have opened your
feet to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution.
\v 26 You have also committed sexual immorality with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied your
prostitution, to provoke me to anger. 
\v 27 See therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your portion, and delivered you to the will of
those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.
\v 28 You have played the prostitute also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have played the prostitute
with them, and yet you weren’t satisfied. 
\v 29 You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants, to Chaldea; and yet you weren’t satisfied with
this. 
\p
\v 30 “‘“How weak is your heart,” says the Lord Yahweh, “since you do all these things, the work of an impudent prostitute;
\v 31 in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have not
been as a prostitute, in that you scorn pay. 
\p
\v 32 “‘“A wife who commits adultery! Who takes strangers instead of her husband!
\v 33 People give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to
you on every side for your prostitution. 
\v 34 You are different from other women in your prostitution, in that no one follows you to play the prostitute; and whereas
you give hire, and no hire is given to you, therefore you are different.”’
\p
\v 35 “Therefore, prostitute, hear Yahweh’s word: 
\v 36 ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh, “Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your
prostitution with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your abominations, and for the blood of your children, that you
gave to them; 
\v 37 therefore see, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those who you have loved, with
all those who you have hated; I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that
they may see all your nakedness. 
\v 38 I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and
jealousy. 
\v 39 I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places; and
they will strip you of your clothes, and take your beautiful jewels. They will leave you naked and bare.
\v 40 They will also bring up a company against you, and they will stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their
swords. 
\v 41 They will burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women. I will cause you to cease
from playing the prostitute, and you will also give no hire any more.
\v 42 So will I cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy will depart from you. I will be quiet, and will be no more
angry. 
\p
\v 43 “‘“Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore,
behold, I also will bring your way on your head,” says the Lord Yahweh: “and you shall not commit this lewdness with all your
abominations. 
\p
\v 44 “‘“Behold, everyone who uses proverbs shall use this proverb against you, saying, ‘As is the mother, so is her daughter.’
\v 45 You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters,
who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
\v 46 Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells at
your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. 
\v 47 Yet you have not walked in their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, soon you were more corrupt than they in
all your ways. 
\v 48 As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your

\p
\v 49 “‘“Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in
her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
\v 50 They were haughty, and committed abomination before me. Therefore I took them away when I saw it.
\v 51 Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have
justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done.
\v 52 You also, bear your own shame yourself, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins that you have
committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous that you. Yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that
you have justified your sisters. 
\p
\v 53 “‘“I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her
daughters, and the captivity of your captives among them; 
\v 54 that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to
them. 
\v 55 Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters will return to
their former estate; and you and your daughters will return to your former estate.
\v 56 For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,
\v 57 before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are around
her, the daughters of the Philistines, who do despite to you all around.
\v 58 You have borne your lewdness and your abominations,” says Yahweh.
\p
\v 59 “‘For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “I will also deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the
covenant. 
\v 60 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting
covenant. 
\v 61 Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your sisters, your elder sisters and your younger; and
I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.
\v 62 I will establish my covenant with you; and you will know that I am Yahweh;
\v 63 that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth any more, because of your shame, when I have forgiven
you all that you have done,” says the Lord Yahweh.’” 
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, tell a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel;
\v 3 and say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “A great eagle with great wings and long feathers, full of feathers, which had
various colors, came to Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar. 
\v 4 He cropped off the topmost of its young twigs, and carried it to a land of traffic. He planted it in a city of merchants.
\p
\v 5 “‘“He also took some of the seed of the land, and planted it in fruitful soil. He placed it beside many waters. He set it
as a willow tree. 
\v 6 It grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him. So it
became a vine, produced branches, and shot out sprigs. 
\p
\v 7 “‘“There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. Behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and
shot out its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.
\v 8 It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might produce branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might
be a good vine.”’ 
\p
\v 9 “Say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Will it prosper? Won’t he pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither;
that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? Not by a strong arm or many people can it be raised from its roots.
\v 10 Yes, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? Won’t it utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It will wither in
the beds where it grew.”’” 
\p
\v 11 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 12 “Say now to the rebellious house, ‘Don’t you know what these things mean?’ Tell them, ‘Behold, the king of Babylon came
to Jerusalem, and took its king, and its princes, and brought them to him to Babylon.
\v 13 He took some of the royal offspring,\f + or, seed\f* and made a covenant with him. He also brought him under an oath, and
took away the mighty of the land; 
\v 14 that the kingdom might be brought low, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.
\v 15 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will
he prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Will he break the covenant, and still escape?
\p
\v 16 “‘As I live,’ says the Lord Yahweh, ‘surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised,
and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the middle of Babylon he will die.
\v 17 Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build
forts, to cut off many persons. 
\v 18 For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these
things. He won’t escape. 
\p
\v 19 “Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has
broken, I will even bring it on his own head. 
\v 20 I will spread my net on him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into
judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.
\v 21 All his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind:
and you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it.’ 
\p
\v 22 “Thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘I will also take some of the lofty top of the cedar, and will plant it. I will crop off from
the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
\v 23 I will plant it in the mountain of the height of Israel; and it will produce boughs, and bear fruit, and be a good cedar.
Birds of every kind will dwell in the shade of its branches. 
\v 24 All the trees of the field will know that I, Yahweh, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have
dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish.
\p I, Yahweh, have spoken and have done it.’” 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me again, saying, 
\v 2 “What do you mean, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying,
\q ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes, 
\q2 and the children’s teeth are set on edge’? 
\p
\v 3 “As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “you shall not use this proverb any more in Israel.
\v 4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins, he shall
die. 
\b
\q
\v 5 “But if a man is just, 
\q2 and does that which is lawful and right, 
\q
\v 6 and has not eaten on the mountains, 
\q2 neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel,
\q neither has defiled his neighbor’s wife, 
\q2 neither has come near to a woman in her impurity, 
\q
\v 7 and has not wronged any, 
\q2 but has restored to the debtor his pledge, 
\q has taken nothing by robbery, 
\q2 has given his bread to the hungry, 
\q2 and has covered the naked with a garment; 
\q
\v 8 he who has not lent on interest, 
\q2 neither has taken any increase, 
\q who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, 
\q2 has executed true justice between man and man, 
\q
\v 9 has walked in my statutes, 
\q2 and has kept my ordinances, 
\q2 to deal truly; 
\q he is just, 
\q2 he shall surely live,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\b
\p
\v 10 “If he fathers a son who is a robber who sheds blood, and who does any one of these things,
\v 11 or who does not do any of those things, 
\q but even has eaten at the mountain shrines, 
\q2 and defiled his neighbor’s wife, 
\q
\v 12 has wronged the poor and needy, 
\q2 has taken by robbery, 
\q has not restored the pledge, 
\q2 and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, 
\q2 has committed abomination, 
\q
\v 13 has lent on interest, 
\q2 and has taken increase; 
\m shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations. He shall surely die. His blood shall be on him.
\p
\v 14 “Now, behold, if he fathers a son, who sees all his father’s sins, which he has done, and fears, and does not such like;
\q
\v 15 who has not eaten on the mountains, 
\q2 neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel,
\q2 has not defiled his neighbor’s wife, 
\q
\v 16 neither has wronged any, 
\q2 has not taken anything to pledge, 
\q neither has taken by robbery, 
\q2 but has given his bread to the hungry, 
\q2 and has covered the naked with a garment; 
\q
\v 17 who has withdrawn his hand from the poor, 
\q2 who has not received interest nor increase, 
\q has executed my ordinances, 
\q2 has walked in my statutes; 
\m he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.
\v 18 As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people,
behold, he shall die in his iniquity. 
\p
\v 19 “Yet you say, ‘Why doesn’t the son bear the iniquity of the father?’ When the son has done that which is lawful and
right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.
\v 20 The soul who sins, he shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the
iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.
\p
\v 21 “But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all my statutes, and does that which is
lawful and right, he shall surely live. He shall not die. 
\v 22 None of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him. In his righteousness that he has done,
he shall live. 
\v 23 Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked?” says the Lord Yahweh; “and not rather that he should return from his
way, and live? 
\p
\v 24 “But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the
abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered. In his
trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them he shall die.
\p
\v 25 “Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not equal.’ Hear now, house of Israel: Is my way not equal? Aren’t your ways
unequal? 
\v 26 When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies therein; in his iniquity that he
has done shall he die. 
\v 27 Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right,
he shall save his soul alive. 
\v 28 Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live. He shall
not die. 
\v 29 Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not fair.’ House of Israel, aren’t my ways fair? Aren’t your ways
unfair? 
\p
\v 30 “Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Return, and turn
yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
\v 31 Cast away from you all your transgressions, in which you have transgressed; and make yourself a new heart and a new
spirit: for why will you die, house of Israel? 
\v 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies,” says the Lord Yahweh. “Therefore turn yourselves, and live!
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 “Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
\v 2 and say, 
\q ‘What was your mother? 
\q2 A lioness. 
\q She couched among lions, 
\q2 in the middle of the young lions she nourished her cubs. 
\q
\v 3 She brought up one of her cubs. 
\q2 He became a young lion, 
\q and he learned to catch the prey. 
\q2 He devoured men. 
\q
\v 4 The nations also heard of him. 
\q2 He was taken in their pit; 
\q2 and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. 
\b
\q
\v 5 “‘Now when she saw that she had waited, 
\q2 and her hope was lost, 
\q then she took another of her cubs,

\q
\v 6 He went up and down among the lions;

\q and he learned to catch the prey. 
\q2 He devoured men. 
\q
\v 7 He knew their palaces, 
\q2 and laid waste their cities;

\q
\v 8 Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces;

\q2 He was taken in their pit. 
\q
\v 9 They put him in a cage with hooks,

\q
\v 10 “‘Your mother was like a vine,

\c 20  
\p
\v 1 In the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of
Yahweh, and sat before me. 
\p
\v 2 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 3 “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Is it to inquire of me that you
have come? As I live,” says the Lord Yahweh, “I will not be inquired of by you.”’
\p
\v 4 “Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers;
\v 5 and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the
offspring\f + or, seed\f* of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them,
saying, ‘I am Yahweh your God;’ 
\v 6 in that day I swore to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing
with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands. 
\v 7 I said to them, ‘Each of you throw away the abominations of his eyes, and don’t defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt.
I am Yahweh your God.’ 
\p
\v 8 “‘“But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me. They didn’t all throw away the abominations of their eyes,
neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my anger against them
in the middle of the land of Egypt. 
\v 9 But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in
whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
\v 10 So I caused them to go out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
\v 11 I gave them my statutes, and showed them my ordinances, which if a man does, he shall live in them.
\v 12 Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am Yahweh who
sanctifies them. 
\p
\v 13 “‘“But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They didn’t walk in my statutes, and they rejected my
ordinances, which if a man keeps, he shall live in them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my
wrath on them in the wilderness, to consume them. 
\v 14 But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I brought
them out. 
\v 15 Moreover also I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them,
flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; 
\v 16 because they rejected my ordinances, and didn’t walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after
their idols. 
\v 17 Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I didn’t destroy them, neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness.
\v 18 I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Don’t walk in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their
ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols. 
\v 19 I am Yahweh your God. Walk in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them;
\v 20 and make my Sabbaths holy; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am Yahweh your God. ’
\p
\v 21 “‘“But the children rebelled against me. They didn’t walk in my statutes, neither kept my ordinances to do them, which if
a man do, he shall live in them. They profaned my Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out my wrath on them, to accomplish my
anger against them in the wilderness. 
\v 22 Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the
nations, in whose sight I brought them out. 
\v 23 Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations, and disperse them through the
countries; 
\v 24 because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes, and had profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes
were after their fathers’ idols. 
\v 25 Moreover also I gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances in which they should not live;
\v 26 and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused all that opens the womb to pass through the fire, that I
might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Yahweh.”’
\p
\v 27 “Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “In this moreover your
fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
\v 28 For when I had brought them into the land, which I swore to give to them, then they saw every high hill, and every thick
tree, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering; there also they made
their pleasant aroma, and they poured out there their drink offerings.
\v 29 Then I said to them, ‘What does the high place where you go mean?’ So its name is called
Bamah\f +  \fr 20:29 \ft “Bamah” means “High Place”.\f* to this day. ”’
\p
\v 30 “Therefore tell the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers?
Do you play the prostitute after their abominations? 
\v 31 When you offer your gifts, when you make your sons to pass through the fire, do you pollute yourselves with all your
idols to this day? Shall I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will not be inquired of
by you!

\v 32 “‘“That which comes into your mind shall not be at all, in that you say, ‘We will be as the nations, as the families of

hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out. 
\v 35 I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.
\v 36 Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment
with you,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 37 “I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
\v 38 I will purge out from among you the rebels, and those who disobey against me. I will bring them out of the land where
they live, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.”
\p
\v 39 “‘As for you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Go, everyone serve his idols, and hereafter also, if you will
not listen to me; but you shall no more profane my holy name with your gifts, and with your idols.
\v 40 For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel,” says the Lord Yahweh, “there shall all the house of
Israel, all of them, serve me in the land. There I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the first
fruits of your offerings, with all your holy things.

fathers.

yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed.
\v 44 You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have dealt with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor
according to your corrupt doings, you house of Israel,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”
\p
\v 45 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 46 “Son of man, set your face toward the south, and preach toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in
the South; 
\v 47 and tell the forest of the South, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word: Thus says the Lord Yahweh, “Behold, I will kindle a fire in you,

\v 48 All flesh shall see that I, Yahweh, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.”’”
\p
\v 49 Then I said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! they say of me, ‘Isn’t he a speaker of parables?’”
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and preach toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel.
\v 3 Tell the land of Israel, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I am against you, and will draw my sword out of its sheath, and will cut
off from you the righteous and the wicked. 
\v 4 Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore my sword will go out of its sheath
against all flesh from the south to the north. 
\v 5 All flesh will know that I, Yahweh, have drawn my sword out of its sheath. It will not return any more.”’
\p
\v 6 “Sigh therefore, you son of man. You shall sigh before their eyes with a broken
heart\f + literally, the breaking of your thighs\f* and with bitterness.
\v 7 It shall be, when they ask you, ‘Why do you sigh?’ that you shall say, ‘Because of the news, for it comes! Every heart
will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes, and it
shall be done, says the Lord Yahweh.’” 
\p
\v 8 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 9 “Son of man, prophesy, and say, ‘Yahweh says:

\v 18 Yahweh’s word came to me again, saying, 
\v 19 “Also, you son of man, appoint two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come. They both shall come out of one
land, and mark out a place; mark it out at the head of the way to the city.
\v 20 You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the

\v 21 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shook the
arrows back and forth. He consulted the teraphim.\f + teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with
inheritance rights to the household property.\f* He looked in the liver.

voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.
\v 23 It shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory,
that they may be taken.

\v 24 “Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions
are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to memory, you shall be taken with the hand.

\v 25 “‘You, deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,

low, and abase that which is high.

it.”’ 
\p
\v 28 “You, son of man, prophesy, and say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their

\q to cause it to devour, 
\q2 that it may be as lightning; 
\q
\v 29 while they see for you false visions, 
\q2 while they divine lies to you, 
\q to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded,
\q2 whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end. 
\q
\v 30 Cause it to return into its sheath. 
\q2 In the place where you were created, 
\q2 in the land of your birth, will I judge you. 
\q
\v 31 I will pour out my indignation on you; 
\q2 I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath; 
\q and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men, 
\q2 skillful to destroy. 
\q
\v 32 You will be for fuel to the fire. 
\q2 Your blood will be in the middle of the land. 
\q You shall be remembered no more; 
\q2 for I, Yahweh, have spoken it.”’” 
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 “You, son of man, will you judge? Will you judge the bloody city? Then cause her to know all her abominations.
\v 3 You shall say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: “A city that sheds blood within herself, that her time may come, and that makes
idols against herself to defile her! 
\v 4 You have become guilty in your blood that you have shed, and are defiled in your idols which you have made! You have
caused your days to draw near, and have come even to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a
mocking to all the countries. 
\v 5 Those who are near, and those who are far from you, will mock you, you infamous one, full of tumult.
\p
\v 6 “‘“Behold, the princes of Israel, everyone according to his power, have been in you to shed blood.
\v 7 In you have they treated father and mother with contempt.\f + 
\fr 22:7 \ft Literally, \fqa made light of father and mother.\f* Among you they have oppressed the foreigner. In you they have
wronged the fatherless and the widow. 
\v 8 You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my Sabbaths.
\v 9 Slanderous men have been in you to shed blood. In you they have eaten on the mountains. They have committed lewdness among
you. 
\v 10 In you have they uncovered their fathers’ nakedness. In you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity.
\v 11 One has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law. Another in
you has humbled his sister, his father’s daughter. 
\v 12 In you have they taken bribes to shed blood. You have taken interest and increase, and you have greedily gained of your
neighbors by oppression, and have forgotten me,” says the Lord Yahweh.
\p
\v 13 “‘“Behold, therefore I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been
within you. 
\v 14 Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I, Yahweh, have spoken it,
and will do it. 
\v 15 I will scatter you among the nations, and disperse you through the countries. I will consume your filthiness out of you.
\v 16 You will be profaned in yourself, in the sight of the nations; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.”’”
\p
\v 17 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 18 “Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me. All of them are brass, tin, iron, and lead in the middle of the
furnace. They are the dross of silver. 
\v 19 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the
middle of Jerusalem. 
\v 20 As they gather silver, brass, iron, lead, and tin into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it; so
will I gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and melt you.
\v 21 Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted in the middle of it.
\v 22 As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so you will be melted in the middle of it; and you will know that I,
Yahweh, have poured out my wrath on you.’” 
\p
\v 23 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 24 “Son of man, tell her, ‘You are a land that is not cleansed, nor rained on in the day of indignation.’
\v 25 There is a conspiracy of her prophets within it, like a roaring lion ravening the prey. They have devoured souls. They
take treasure and precious things. They have made her widows many within it.
\v 26 Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the
holy and the common, neither have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hidden their eyes from
my Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. 
\v 27 Her princes within it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest
gain. 
\v 28 Her prophets have plastered for them with whitewash, seeing false visions, and divining lies to them, saying, ‘Thus says
the Lord Yahweh,’ when Yahweh has not spoken. 
\v 29 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery. Yes, they have troubled the poor and needy, and have
oppressed the foreigner wrongfully. 
\p
\v 30 “I sought for a man among them, who should build up the wall, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should
not destroy it; but I found no one. 
\v 31 Therefore I have poured out my indignation on them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have brought their
own way on their heads,” says the Lord Yahweh. 
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, 
\v 2 “Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.
\v 3 They played the prostitute in Egypt. They played the prostitute in their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and
their youthful nipples were caressed there. 
\v 4 Their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for
their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah. 
\p
\v 5 “Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine. She doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,
\v 6 who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
\v 7 She gave herself as a prostitute to them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them. She defiled herself with the idols of
whoever she lusted after. 
\v 8 She hasn’t left her prostitution since leaving Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her. They carressed her youthful
nipples; and they poured out their prostitution on her. 
\p
\v 9 “Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted.
\v 10 These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters; and they killed her with the sword. She became a
byword among women; for they executed judgments on her. 
\p
\v 11 “Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her lusting than she, and in her prostitution which was more
depraved than the prostitution of her sister. 
\v 12 She lusted after the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses,
all of them desirable young men. 
\v 13 I saw that she was defiled. They both went the same way. 
\p
\v 14 “She increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with
vermilion, 
\v 15 dressed with girdles on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like princes, after the
likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth.
\v 16 As soon as she saw them she lusted after them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.
\v 17 The Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution. She was polluted with
them, and her soul was alienated from them. 
\v 18 So she uncovered her prostitution, and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just like my soul
was alienated from her sister. 
\v 19 Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had played the prostitute in the
land of Egypt. 
\v 20 She lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
\v 21 Thus you called to memory the lewdness of your youth, in the caressing of your nipples by the Egyptians because of your
youthful breasts. 
\p
\v 22 “Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is
alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side: 
\v 23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors
and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.
\v 24 They will come against you with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They will set themselves
against you with buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according
to their judgments. 
\v 25 I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury; they will take away your nose and your ears; and
your remnant will fall by the sword. They will take your sons and your daughters; and your residue will be devoured by the
fire. 
\v 26 They will also strip you of your clothes, and take away your beautiful jewels.
\v 27 Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and remove your prostitution from the land of Egypt; so that you will
not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.’ 
\p
\v 28 “For thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them
from whom your soul is alienated. 
\v 29 They will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labor, and shall leave you naked and bare. The nakedness
of your prostitution will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution.
\v 30 These things will be done to you, because you have played the prostitute after the nations, and because you are polluted
with their idols. 
\v 31 You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into your hand.’
\p
\v 32 “Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q ‘You will drink of your sister’s cup, 
\q2 which is deep and large. 
\q You will be ridiculed and held in derision. 
\q2 It contains much. 
\q
\v 33 You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, 
\q2 with the cup of astonishment and desolation, 
\q2 with the cup of your sister Samaria. 
\q
\v 34 You will even drink it and drain it out. 
\q2 You will gnaw the broken pieces of it, 
\q2 and will tear your breasts; 
\m for I have spoken it,’ says the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 35 “Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore you also
bear your lewdness and your prostitution.’” 
\p
\v 36 Yahweh said moreover to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.
\v 37 For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols. They have
also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire to them to be devoured.
\v 38 Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.
\v 39 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and
behold, thus have they done in the middle of my house. 
\p
\v 40 “Furthermore you sisters have sent for men who come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and behold, they came;
for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, decorated yourself with ornaments,
\v 41 and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon you set my incense and my oil.
\p
\v 42 “The voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. With men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the
wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.
\v 43 Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, ‘Now they will play the prostitute with her, and she with them.’
\v 44 They went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.
\v 45 Righteous men will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses and with the judgment of women who shed blood; because
they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. 
\p
\v 46 “For thus says the Lord Yahweh: ‘I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed back and forth
and robbed. 
\v 47 The company will stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords. They will kill their sons and their
daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. 
\p
\v 48 “‘Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to be lewd like you.
\v 49 They shall recompense your lewdness on you, and you will bear the sins of your idols; and you shall know that I am the
Lord Yahweh.’” 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, write the name of the day, this same day. The king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day.
\v 3 Utter a parable to the rebellious house, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh,
\q Set on the cauldron, 
\q2 set it on, 
\q2 and also pour water into it: 
\q
\v 4 gather its pieces into it, 
\q2 even every good piece, 
\q2 the thigh, and the shoulder; 
\q2 fill it with the choice bones. 
\q
\v 5 Take the choice of the flock, 
\q2 and also a pile of wood for the bones under the cauldron; 
\q make it boil well; 
\q2 yes, let its bones be boiled within it. 
\m
\v 6 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q Woe to the bloody city, 
\q2 to the cauldron whose rust is therein, 
\q2 and whose rust is not gone out of it! 
\q take out of it piece after piece; 
\q2 No lot is fallen on it. 
\b
\q
\v 7 For her blood is in the middle of her; 
\q2 she set it on the bare rock; 
\q she didn’t pour it on the ground, 
\q2 to cover it with dust. 
\q
\v 8 That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, 
\q2 I have set her blood on the bare rock, 
\q2 that it should not be covered. 
\m
\v 9 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q Woe to the bloody city! 
\q2 I also will make the pile great. 
\q
\v 10 Heap on the wood, 
\q2 make the fire hot, 
\q boil the meat well, 
\q2 and make the broth thick, 
\q2 and let the bones be burned. 
\q
\v 11 Then set it empty on its coals, 
\q2 that it may be hot, 
\q and its brass may burn, 
\q2 and that its filthiness may be molten in it, 
\q2 that its rust may be consumed. 
\q
\v 12 She is weary with toil; 
\q2 yet her great rust, 
\q2 rust by fire, doesn’t leave her. 
\p
\v 13 In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed you and you weren’t cleansed, you shall not be cleansed from your
filthiness any more, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest.
\p
\v 14 I, Yahweh, have spoken it: it shall happen, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I
repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, says the Lord Yahweh.
\p
\v 15 Also Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 16 Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet you shall neither mourn nor
weep, neither shall your tears run down. 
\v 17 Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind your headdress on you, and put your shoes on your feet, and
don’t cover your lips, and don’t eat men’s bread. 
\p
\v 18 So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at evening my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
\p
\v 19 The people said to me, Won’t you tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?
\p
\v 20 Then I said to them, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 21 Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power,
the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind shall fall
by the sword. 
\v 22 You shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
\v 23 Your tires shall be on your heads, and your shoes on your feet: you shall not mourn nor weep; but you shall pine away in
your iniquities, and moan one toward another. 
\v 24 Thus Ezekiel shall be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, you will do. When this comes, then you will know
that I am the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 25 You, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of
their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,
\v 26 that in that day he who escapes shall come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?
\v 27 In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you shall speak, and be no more mute: so you will be a
sign to them; and they shall know that I am Yahweh. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them:
\v 3 and tell the children of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh: Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Because you said, Aha,
against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate; and against the house of
Judah, when they went into captivity: 
\v 4 therefore, behold, I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments
in you, and make their dwellings in you; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
\v 5 I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a resting place for flocks: and you shall know that I am
Yahweh. 
\v 6 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because you have clapped your hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the
despite of your soul against the land of Israel; 
\v 7 therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand on you, and will deliver you for a plunder to the nations; and I will cut
you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries: I will destroy you; and you shall know that I am
Yahweh. 
\p
\v 8 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because Moab and Seir say, Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations;
\v 9 therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of
the country, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim, 
\v 10 to the children of the east, to go against the children of Ammon; and I will give them for a possession, that the
children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. 
\v 11 and I will execute judgments on Moab; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 12 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly
offended, and revenged himself on them; 
\v 13 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, I will stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and animal from it; and I
will make it desolate from Teman; even to Dedan shall they fall by the sword.
\v 14 I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and
according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord Yahweh.
\p
\v 15 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with despite of soul
to destroy with perpetual hostility; 
\v 16 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the
Cherethites, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. 
\v 17 I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes; and they shall know that I am Yahweh, when I shall lay my
vengeance on them. 
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 In the eleventh year, in the first of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken: the gate of the peoples; she is turned to me; I
shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste: 
\v 3 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you,
as the sea causes its waves to come up. 
\v 4 They shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare
rock. 
\v 5 She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the middle of the sea; for I have spoken it, says the Lord Yahweh; and
she shall become a plunder to the nations. 
\v 6 Her daughters who are in the field shall be slain with the sword: and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 7 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north,
with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and many people.
\v 8 He shall kill your daughters in the field with the sword; and he shall make forts against you, and cast up a mound against
you, and raise up the buckler against you. 
\v 9 He shall set his battering engines against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.
\v 10 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you: your walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen,
and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into your gates, as men enter into a city in which is made a
breach. 
\v 11 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets; he shall kill your people with the sword; and the
pillars of your strength shall go down to the ground. 
\v 12 They shall make a plunder of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise; and they shall break down your walls, and
destroy your pleasant houses; and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the middle of the waters.
\v 13 I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard.
\v 14 I will make you a bare rock; you shall be a place for the spreading of nets; you shall be built no more: for I Yahweh
have spoken it, says the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 15 Thus says the Lord Yahweh to Tyre: shall not the islands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when
the slaughter is made within you? 
\v 16 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their
embroidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit on the ground, and shall tremble every
moment, and be astonished at you. 
\v 17 They shall take up a lamentation over you, and tell you, 
\q How you are destroyed, 
\q2 who were inhabited by seafaring men, 
\q the renowned city, 
\q2 who was strong in the sea, 
\q she and her inhabitants, 
\q2 who caused their terror to be on all who lived there! 
\q
\v 18 Now shall the islands tremble in the day of your fall; 
\q2 yes, the islands that are in the sea shall be dismayed at your departure.
\p
\v 19 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: When I shall make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I
shall bring up the deep on you, and the great waters shall cover you;
\v 20 then I will bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and will make you to dwell in
the lower parts of the earth, in the places that are desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, that you be not
inhabited; and I will set glory in the land of the living: 
\v 21 I will make you a terror, and you shall no more have any being; though you are sought for, yet you will never be found
again, says the Lord Yahweh. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, 
\v 2 You, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre; 
\v 3 and tell Tyre, you who dwell at the entry of the sea, who are the merchant of the peoples to many islands, thus says the
Lord Yahweh: 
\q You, Tyre, have said, 
\q2 I am perfect in beauty. 
\q
\v 4 Your borders are in the heart of the seas; 
\q2 your builders have perfected your beauty. 
\q
\v 5 They have made all your planks of cypress trees from Senir;
\q2 they have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
\q
\v 6 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars; 
\q2 they have made your benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood, 
\q2 from the islands of Kittim. 
\q
\v 7 Your sail was of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt,
\q2 that it might be to you for a banner; 
\q2 blue and purple from the islands of Elishah was your awning.
\q
\v 8 The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers: 
\q2 your wise men, Tyre, were in you, 
\q2 they were your pilots. 
\q
\v 9 The old men of Gebal 
\q2 and its wise men were your repairers of ship seams in you: 
\q all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you 
\q2 to deal in your merchandise. 
\b
\q
\v 10 Persia and Lud and Put were in your army, 
\q2 your men of war: 
\q they hanged the shield and helmet in you; 
\q2 they showed your beauty. 
\q
\v 11 The men of Arvad with your army were on your walls all around,
\q2 and valorous men were in your towers; 
\q they hung their shields on your walls all around; 
\q2 they have perfected your beauty. 
\p
\v 12 Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they
traded for your wares. 
\p
\v 13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your traffickers; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for your
merchandise. 
\p
\v 14 They of the house of Togarmah traded for your wares with horses and war horses and mules.
\p
\v 15 The men of Dedan were your traffickers; many islands were the market of your hand: they brought you in exchange horns of
ivory and ebony. 
\p
\v 16 Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of your handiworks: they traded for your wares with emeralds, purple,
and embroidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and rubies. 
\p
\v 17 Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your traffickers: they traded for your merchandise wheat of Minnith, and
confections, and honey, and oil, and balm. 
\p
\v 18 Damascus was your merchant for the multitude of your handiworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with
the wine of Helbon, and white wool. 
\p
\v 19 Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for your wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were among your merchandise.
\p
\v 20 Dedan was your trafficker in precious cloths for riding. 
\p
\v 21 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they were the merchants of your hand; in lambs, and rams, and goats, in these were
they your merchants. 
\p
\v 22 The traffickers of Sheba and Raamah, they were your traffickers; they traded for your wares with the chief of all spices,
and with all precious stones, and gold. 
\p
\v 23 Haran and Canneh and Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad, were your traffickers.
\v 24 These were your traffickers in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and embroidered work, and in chests of rich clothing,
bound with cords and made of cedar, among your merchandise. 
\q
\v 25 The ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise:
\q2 and you were replenished, 
\q2 and made very glorious in the heart of the seas. 
\q
\v 26 Your rowers have brought you into great waters: 
\q2 the east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas. 
\q
\v 27 Your riches, 
\q2 and your wares, 
\q2 your merchandise, 
\q your mariners, 
\q2 and your pilots, 
\q2 your repairers of ship seams, 
\q and the dealers in your merchandise, 
\q2 and all your men of war, who are in you, 
\q with all your company which is among you, 
\q2 shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of your ruin.
\q
\v 28 At the sound of the cry of your pilots 
\q2 the suburbs shall shake. 
\q
\v 29 All who handled the oar, 
\q2 the mariners, 
\q2 and all the pilots of the sea, 
\q shall come down from their ships; 
\q2 they shall stand on the land, 
\q
\v 30 and shall cause their voice to be heard over you, 
\q2 and shall cry bitterly, 
\q and shall cast up dust on their heads, 
\q2 they shall wallow themselves in the ashes: 
\q
\v 31 and they shall make themselves bald for you, 
\q2 and clothe them with sackcloth, 
\q and they shall weep for you in bitterness of soul 
\q2 with bitter mourning. 
\q
\v 32 In their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you,
\q2 and lament over you, saying, 
\q Who is there like Tyre, 
\q2 like her who is brought to silence in the middle of the sea?
\q
\v 33 When your wares went out of the seas, 
\q2 you filled many peoples; 
\q you enriched the kings of the earth 
\q2 with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise. 
\q
\v 34 In the time that you were broken by the seas 
\q2 in the depths of the waters, 
\q your merchandise 
\q2 and all your company fell within you. 
\q
\v 35 All the inhabitants of the islands are astonished at you, 
\q2 and their kings are horribly afraid; 
\q2 they are troubled in their face. 
\q
\v 36 The merchants among the peoples hiss at you; 
\q2 you have become a terror, 
\q2 and you will be no more. 
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, tell the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:
\q Because your heart is lifted up, 
\q2 and you have said, I am a god, 
\q I sit in the seat of God, 
\q2 in the middle of the seas; 
\q yet you are man, 
\q2 and not God, 
\q2 though you set your heart as the heart of God— 
\q
\v 3 behold, you are wiser than Daniel; 
\q2 there is no secret that is hidden from you; 
\q
\v 4 by your wisdom and by your understanding you have gotten yourself riches,
\q2 and have gotten gold and silver into your treasures; 
\q
\v 5 by your great wisdom 
\q2 and by your traffic you have increased your riches, 
\q2 and your heart is lifted up because of your riches— 
\p
\v 6 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q Because you have set your heart as the heart of God, 
\q2
\v 7 therefore, behold, I will bring strangers on you, 
\q2 the terrible of the nations; 
\q and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom,
\q2 and they shall defile your brightness. 
\q
\v 8 They shall bring you down to the pit; 
\q2 and you shall die the death of those who are slain, 
\q2 in the heart of the seas. 
\q
\v 9 Will you yet say before him who kills you, I am God? 
\q2 but you are man, and not God, 
\q2 in the hand of him who wounds you. 
\q
\v 10 You shall die the death of the uncircumcised 
\q2 by the hand of strangers: 
\q2 for I have spoken it, says the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 11 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 12 Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and tell him, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:
\q You were the seal of full measure, 
\q2 full of wisdom, 
\q2 and perfect in beauty. 
\q
\v 13 You were in Eden, 
\q2 the garden of God; 
\q every precious stone adorned you: 
\q2 ruby, topaz, emerald, 
\q2 chrysolite, onyx, jasper, 
\q2 sapphire,\f + or, lapis lazuli \f* turquoise, and beryl. 
\q Gold work of tambourines 
\q2 and of pipes was in you. 
\q2 In the day that you were created they were prepared. 
\q
\v 14 You were the anointed cherub who covers: 
\q2 and I set you, so that you were on the holy mountain of God;
\q2 you have walked up and down in the middle of the stones of fire.
\q
\v 15 You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created,
\q2 until unrighteousness was found in you. 
\q
\v 16 By the abundance of your traffic they filled your insides with violence,
\q2 and you have sinned: 
\q therefore I have cast you as profane out of the mountain of God;
\q2 and I have destroyed you, covering cherub, 
\q2 from the middle of the stones of fire. 
\q
\v 17 Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; 
\q2 you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness:
\q I have cast you to the ground; 
\q2 I have laid you before kings, 
\q2 that they may see you. 
\q
\v 18 By the multitude of your iniquities, 
\q2 in the unrighteousness of your traffic, 
\q2 you have profaned your sanctuaries; 
\q therefore I have brought out a fire from the middle of you; 
\q2 it has devoured you, 
\q and I have turned you to ashes on the earth 
\q2 in the sight of all those who see you. 
\q
\v 19 All those who know you among the peoples shall be astonished at you:
\q2 you have become a terror, 
\q2 and you shall exist no more. 
\p
\v 20 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 21 Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,
\v 22 and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q Behold, I am against you, Sidon; 
\q2 and I will be glorified among you; 
\q and they shall know that I am Yahweh, 
\q2 when I shall have executed judgments in her, 
\q2 and shall be sanctified in her. 
\q
\v 23 For I will send pestilence into her, 
\q2 and blood into her streets; 
\q and the wounded shall fall within her, 
\q2 with the sword on her on every side; 
\q2 and they shall know that I am Yahweh. 
\p
\v 24 There shall be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any that are around them, that
scorned them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 25 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered,
and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant
Jacob. 
\v 26 They shall dwell securely therein; yes, they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell securely, when I
have executed judgments on all those who do them despite all around them; and they shall know that I am Yahweh their God.
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 2 “Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
\v 3 Speak and say, ‘Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q “Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, 
\q2 the great monster that lies in the middle of his rivers, 
\q that has said, ‘My river is my own, 
\q2 and I have made it for myself.’ 
\q
\v 4 I will put hooks in your jaws, 
\q2 and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales;
\q and I will bring you up out of the middle of your rivers, 
\q2 with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales.
\q
\v 5 I’ll cast you out into the wilderness, 
\q2 you and all the fish of your rivers. 
\q You’ll fall on the open field. 
\q2 You won’t be brought together, 
\q2 nor gathered. 
\q I have given you for food to the animals of the earth 
\q2 and to the birds of the sky. 
\p
\v 6 All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
\v 7 When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke, and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke,
and paralyzed all of their thighs.” 
\p
\v 8 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: “Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and will cut off man and animal from you.
\v 9 The land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
\p Because he has said, ‘The river is mine, and I have made it;’
\v 10 therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and
desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.
\v 11 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of animal shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty
years. 
\v 12 I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the middle of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the
cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will
disperse them through the countries.” 
\p
\v 13 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: “At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were
scattered; 
\v 14 and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of
their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom. 
\v 15 It shall be the base of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish
them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. 
\v 16 It shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn to look after
them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh.”’” 
\p
\v 17 It came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to
me, saying, 
\v 18 Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made
bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.
\v 19 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and he
shall carry off her multitude, and take her plunder, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
\v 20 I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they worked for me, says the Lord
Yahweh. 
\p
\v 21 In that day will I cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel, and I will give you the opening of the mouth among
them; and they shall know that I am Yahweh. 
\c 30  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q Wail, Alas for the day! 
\q2
\v 3 For the day is near, 
\q2 even the day of Yahweh is near; 
\q it shall be a day of clouds, 
\q2 a time of the nations. 
\q
\v 4 A sword shall come on Egypt, 
\q2 and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, 
\q2 when the slain shall fall in Egypt; 
\q and they shall take away her multitude, 
\q2 and her foundations shall be broken down. 
\m
\v 5 Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mixed people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is allied with them,
shall fall with them by the sword. 
\p
\v 6 Yahweh says: 
\q They also who uphold Egypt shall fall; 
\q2 and the pride of her power shall come down: 
\q they shall fall by the sword in it from the tower of Seveneh,
\q2 says the Lord Yahweh. 
\q
\v 7 They shall be desolate in the middle of the countries that are desolate;
\q2 and her cities shall be in the middle of the cities that are wasted.
\q
\v 8 They shall know that I am Yahweh, 
\q2 when I have set a fire in Egypt, 
\q2 and all her helpers are destroyed. 
\p
\v 9 In that day messengers will go out from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be
anguish on them, as in the day of Egypt; for, behold, it comes. 
\p
\v 10 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, 
\q2 by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. 
\q
\v 11 He and his people with him, 
\q2 the terrible of the nations, 
\q shall be brought in to destroy the land; 
\q2 and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, 
\q2 and fill the land with the slain. 
\q
\v 12 I will make the rivers dry, 
\q2 and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; 
\q and I will make the land desolate, 
\q2 and all that is therein, 
\q2 by the hand of strangers: 
\q2 I, Yahweh, have spoken it. 
\p
\v 13 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q I will also destroy the idols, 
\q2 and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; 
\q and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: 
\q2 and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. 
\q
\v 14 I will make Pathros desolate, 
\q2 and will set a fire in Zoan, 
\q2 and will execute judgments on No. 
\q
\v 15 I will pour my wrath on Sin, 
\q2 the stronghold of Egypt; 
\q2 and I will cut off the multitude of No. 
\q
\v 16 I will set a fire in Egypt: 
\q2 Sin shall be in great anguish, 
\q and No shall be broken up; 
\q2 and Memphis shall have adversaries in the daytime. 
\q
\v 17 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword;
\q2 and they shall go into captivity. 
\q
\v 18 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, 
\q2 when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, 
\q and the pride of her power shall cease in her: 
\q2 as for her, a cloud shall cover her, 
\q2 and her daughters shall go into captivity. 
\q
\v 19 Thus will I execute judgments on Egypt; 
\q2 and they shall know that I am Yahweh. 
\p
\v 20 In the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 21 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and behold, it has not been bound up, to apply medicines, to
put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword. 
\v 22 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong arm,
and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
\v 23 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
\v 24 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh,
and he shall groan before him with the groaning of a mortally wounded man.
\v 25 I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am
Yahweh, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out on the land of Egypt.
\v 26 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am
Yahweh. 
\c 31  
\p
\v 1 In the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude:
\q Whom are you like in your greatness? 
\q
\v 3 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon 
\q2 with beautiful branches, 
\q and with a forest-like shade, 
\q2 and of high stature; 
\q2 and its top was among the thick boughs. 
\q
\v 4 The waters nourished it, 
\q2 the deep made it to grow: 
\q its rivers ran all around its plantation; 
\q2 and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field. 
\q
\v 5 Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field;
\q2 and its boughs were multiplied, 
\q and its branches became long by reason of many waters, 
\q2 when it spread them out. 
\q
\v 6 All the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs; 
\q2 and under its branches all the animals of the field gave birth to their young;
\q2 and all great nations lived under its shadow. 
\q
\v 7 Thus was it beautiful in its greatness, 
\q2 in the length of its branches; 
\q2 for its root was by many waters. 
\q
\v 8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; 
\q2 the cypress trees were not like its boughs, 
\q and the pine trees were not as its branches; 
\q2 nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.
\q
\v 9 I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches, 
\q2 so that all the trees of Eden, 
\q2 that were in the garden of God, envied it. 
\p
\v 10 Therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh: Because you are exalted in stature, and he has set his top among the thick boughs,
and his heart is lifted up in his height; 
\v 11 I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him
out for his wickedness. 
\v 12 Strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: on the mountains and in all the valleys his
branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone
down from his shadow, and have left him. 
\v 13 On his ruin all the birds of the sky shall dwell, and all the animals of the field shall be on his branches;
\v 14 to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the
thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, even all who drink water: for they are all delivered to
death, to the lower parts of the earth, among the children of men, with those who go down to the pit.
\p
\v 15 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: In the day when he went down to Sheol
\f + Sheol is the place of the dead.\f* I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its rivers; and the
great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
\v 16 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to
Sheol\f + Sheol is the place of the dead.\f* with those who descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and
best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.
\v 17 They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, who lived under
his shadow in the middle of the nations. 
\p
\v 18 To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet you will be brought down with the trees
of Eden to the lower parts of the earth: you shall lie in the middle of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the
sword. 
\p This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord Yahweh. 
\c 32  
\p
\v 1 In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 2 Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him,
\q You were likened to a young lion of the nations: 
\q2 yet you are as a monster in the seas; 
\q and you broke out with your rivers, 
\q2 and troubled the waters with your feet, 
\q2 and fouled their rivers. 
\q
\v 3 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q2 I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples;
\q2 and they shall bring you up in my net. 
\q
\v 4 I will leave you on the land, 
\q2 I will cast you out on the open field, 
\q and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you, 
\q2 and I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you. 
\q
\v 5 I will lay your flesh on the mountains, 
\q2 and fill the valleys with your height. 
\q
\v 6 I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim,
\q2 even to the mountains; 
\q2 and the watercourses shall be full of you. 
\q
\v 7 When I shall extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, 
\q2 and make its stars dark; 
\q I will cover the sun with a cloud, 
\q2 and the moon shall not give its light. 
\q
\v 8 I will make all the bright lights of the sky dark over you,
\q2 and set darkness on your land, says the Lord Yahweh. 
\q
\v 9 I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, 
\q2 when I shall bring your destruction among the nations, 
\q2 into the countries which you have not known. 
\q
\v 10 Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, 
\q2 and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you, 
\q when I shall brandish my sword before them; 
\q2 and they shall tremble at every moment, 
\q every man for his own life, 
\q2 in the day of your fall. 
\q
\v 11 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: 
\q2 The sword of the king of Babylon shall come on you. 
\q
\v 12 By the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall;
\q2 they are all the ruthless of the nations: 
\q and they shall bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, 
\q2 and all its multitude shall be destroyed. 
\q
\v 13 I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters;
\q2 neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, 
\q2 nor the hoofs of animals trouble them. 
\q
\v 14 Then will I make their waters clear, 
\q2 and cause their rivers to run like oil, 
\q2 says the Lord Yahweh. 
\q
\v 15 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, 
\q2 a land destitute of that of which it was full, 
\q when I shall strike all those who dwell therein, 
\q2 then shall they know that I am Yahweh. 
\p
\v 16 This is the lamentation with which they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt,
and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, says the Lord Yahweh.
\p
\v 17 Also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,
\v 18 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, to
the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.
\v 19 Whom do you pass in beauty? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.
\v 20 They shall fall among those who are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her
multitudes. 
\v 21 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the middle of Sheol
\f + Sheol is the place of the dead.\f* with those who help him: they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised,
slain by the sword. 
\p
\v 22 Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are all around her; all of them slain, fallen by the sword;
\v 23 whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by
the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living. 
\p
\v 24 There is Elam and all her multitude around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down
uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame
with those who go down to the pit. 
\v 25 They have set her a bed among the slain with all her multitude; her graves are around her; all of them uncircumcised,
slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with those who go
down to the pit: he is put among those who are slain. 
\p
\v 26 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are around them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the
sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living. 
\v 27 They shall not lie with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of
war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are on their bones; for they were the terror of the
mighty in the land of the living. 
\p
\v 28 But you shall be broken among the uncircumcised, and shall lie with those who are slain by the sword.
\p
\v 29 There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword: they
shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.
\p
\v 30 There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who are gone down with the slain; in the terror
which they caused by their might they are put to shame; and they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and
bear their shame with those who go down to the pit. 
\p
\v 31 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword,
says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 32 For I have put his terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid among the uncircumcised, with those who are
slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord Yahweh.
\c 33  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them, When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the
land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;
\v 3 if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
\v 4 then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and doesn’t take warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood
shall be on his own head. 
\v 5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and didn’t take warning; his blood shall be on him; whereas if he had taken warning, he
would have delivered his soul. 
\v 6 But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn’t blow the trumpet, and the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes,
and take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.
\p
\v 7 So you, son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
warning from me. 
\v 8 When I tell the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die, and you don’t speak to warn the wicked from his way; that
wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at your hand.
\v 9 Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he doesn’t turn from his way; he shall die in his
iniquity, but you have delivered your soul. 
\p
\v 10 You, son of man, tell the house of Israel: Thus you speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we pine
away in them; how then can we live? 
\v 11 Tell them, As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from
his way and live: turn, turn from your evil ways; for why will you die, house of Israel?
\p
\v 12 You, son of man, tell the children of your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of
his disobedience; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns from his
wickedness; neither shall he who is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sins.
\v 13 When I tell the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his
righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he has committed, therein shall he die.
\v 14 Again, when I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
\v 15 if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing
no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
\v 16 None of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him: he has done that which is lawful and right; he
shall surely live. 
\p
\v 17 Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.
\v 18 When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he shall even die therein.
\v 19 When the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
\v 20 Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. House of Israel, I will judge every one of you after his ways.
\p
\v 21 In the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, one who had escaped out of
Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city has been struck. 
\v 22 Now Yahweh’s hand had been on me in the evening, before he who was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he
came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more mute.
\p
\v 23 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 24 Son of man, they who inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited
the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.
\v 25 Therefore tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: You eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed
blood: and shall you possess the land? 
\v 26 You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and every one of you defiles his neighbor’s wife: and shall you possess
the land? 
\p
\v 27 You shall tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the
sword; and him who is in the open field will I give to the animals to be devoured; and those who are in the strongholds and in
the caves shall die of the pestilence. 
\v 28 I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains of
Israel shall be desolate, so that no one shall pass through. 
\v 29 Then shall they know that I am Yahweh, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all their
abominations which they have committed. 
\p
\v 30 As for you, son of man, the children of your people talk of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak to
one another, everyone to his brother, saying, Please come and hear what is the word that comes out from Yahweh.
\v 31 They come to you as the people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but don’t do them;
for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain.
\v 32 Behold, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for
they hear your words, but they don’t do them. 
\p
\v 33 When this comes to pass, (behold, it comes), then shall they know that a prophet has been among them.
\c 34  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and tell them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord
Yahweh: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Shouldn’t the shepherds feed the sheep?
\v 3 You eat the fat, and you clothe yourself with the wool, you kill the fatlings; but you don’t feed the sheep.
\v 4 You haven’t strengthened the diseased, neither have you healed that which was sick, neither have you bound up that which
was broken, neither have you brought back that which was driven away, neither have you sought that which was lost; but with
force and with rigor you have ruled over them. 
\v 5 They were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the animals of the field, and were
scattered. 
\v 6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill: yes, my sheep were scattered on all the surface of
the earth; and there was no one who searched or sought. 
\p
\v 7 Therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word: 
\v 8 As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the animals of the
field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and
didn’t feed my sheep; 
\v 9 therefore, you shepherds, hear Yahweh’s word: 
\v 10 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them
to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep from their
mouth, that they may not be food for them. 
\p
\v 11 For thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.
\v 12 As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my
sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
\v 13 I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and
I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.
\v 14 I will feed them with good pasture; and on the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they
lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel.
\v 15 I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 16 I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken,
and will strengthen that which was sick: but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them in justice.
\p
\v 17 As for you, O my flock, thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the male goats.
\v 18 Does it seem a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture, but you must tread down with your feet the residue of
your pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but you must foul the residue with your feet?
\v 19 As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which you have fouled with your
feet. 
\p
\v 20 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh to them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
\v 21 Because you thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, until you have scattered them
abroad; 
\v 22 therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
\v 23 I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be
their shepherd. 
\v 24 I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them; I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
\p
\v 25 I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell
securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. 
\v 26 I will make them and the places around my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there
shall be showers of blessing. 
\v 27 The tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their
land; and they shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand
of those who made slaves of them. 
\v 28 They shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the animals of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell
securely, and no one shall make them afraid. 
\v 29 I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear
the shame of the nations any more. 
\v 30 They shall know that I, Yahweh, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord
Yahweh. 
\v 31 You my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, says the Lord Yahweh.
\c 35  
\p
\v 1 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
\v 3 and tell it, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you,
and I will make you a desolation and an astonishment. 
\v 4 I will lay your cities waste, and you shall be desolate; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
\v 5 Because you have had a perpetual hostility, and have given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the
time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end; 
\v 6 therefore, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you: since you have not
hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you. 
\v 7 Thus will I make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation; and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him
who returns. 
\v 8 I will fill its mountains with its slain: in your hills and in your valleys and in all your watercourses shall they fall
who are slain with the sword. 
\v 9 I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall not be inhabited; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 10 Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Yahweh
was there: 
\v 11 therefore, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will do according to your anger, and according to your envy which you have
shown out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I shall judge you.
\v 12 You shall know that I, Yahweh, have heard all your insults which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying,
They are laid desolate, they have been given us to devour. 
\v 13 You have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard it.
\v 14 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
\v 15 As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to you: you shall be
desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
\c 36  
\p
\v 1 You, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, You mountains of Israel, hear Yahweh’s word.
\v 2 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because the enemy has said against you, Aha! and, The ancient high places are ours in
possession; 
\v 3 therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed
you up on every side, that you might be a possession to the residue of the nations, and you are taken up in the lips of
talkers, and the evil report of the people; 
\v 4 therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh: Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains and to
the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become
a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are all around;
\v 5 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue of the nations,
and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite
of soul, to cast it out for a prey. 
\v 6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and tell the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the
valleys, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you have borne the shame of
the nations: 
\v 7 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: I have sworn, Surely the nations that are around you, they shall bear their shame.
\p
\v 8 But you, mountains of Israel, you shall shoot out your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at
hand to come. 
\v 9 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn into you, and you shall be tilled and sown;
\v 10 and I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste
places shall be built; 
\v 11 and I will multiply on you man and animal; and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited
after your former estate, and you will do better than at your beginnings: and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
\v 12 Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess you, and you shall be their
inheritance, and you shall no more henceforth bereave them of children.
\p
\v 13 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because they say to you, You are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver of your nation;
\v 14 therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your nation any more, says the Lord Yahweh;
\v 15 neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations, neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any
more, neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more, says the Lord Yahweh.
\p
\v 16 Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 17 Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way
before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity. 
\v 18 Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land, and because they had defiled
it with their idols; 
\v 19 and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and
according to their doings I judged them. 
\v 20 When they came to the nations, where they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the
people of Yahweh, and are gone out of his land. 
\v 21 But I had respect for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, where they went.
\p
\v 22 Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I don’t do this for your sake, house of Israel, but for my
holy name, which you have profaned among the nations, where you went.
\v 23 I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned among them; and the
nations shall know that I am Yahweh, says the Lord Yahweh, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
\p
\v 24 For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own
land. 
\v 25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I
cleanse you. 
\v 26 I will also give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of
your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. 
\v 27 I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you shall keep my ordinances, and do them.
\v 28 You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\v 29 I will save you from all your uncleanness: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you.
\v 30 I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that you may receive no more the reproach of famine
among the nations. 
\p
\v 31 Then you shall remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own
sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. 
\v 32 Nor for your sake do I this, says the Lord Yahweh, be it known to you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, house of
Israel. 
\p
\v 33 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be
inhabited, and the waste places shall be built. 
\v 34 The land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.
\v 35 They shall say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined
cities are fortified and inhabited. 
\v 36 Then the nations that are left around you shall know that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places, and planted that which
was desolate: I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I will do it. 
\p
\v 37 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will
increase them with men like a flock. 
\v 38 As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with
flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Yahweh. 
\c 37  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s hand was on me, and he brought me out in Yahweh’s Spirit, and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was
full of bones. 
\v 2 He caused me to pass by them all around: and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very
dry. 
\v 3 He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? 
\p I answered, Lord Yahweh, you know. 
\p
\v 4 Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, you dry bones, hear Yahweh’s word.
\v 5 Thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.
\v 6 I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall
live; and you shall know that I am Yahweh. 
\p
\v 7 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, an earthquake; and the bones came
together, bone to its bone. 
\v 8 I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in
them. 
\p
\v 9 Then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Come from
the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.
\v 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an
exceedingly great army. 
\p
\v 11 Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and
our hope is lost; we are clean cut off. 
\v 12 Therefore prophesy, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up
out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
\v 13 You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people.
\v 14 I will put my Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and you shall know that I,
Yahweh, have spoken it and performed it, says Yahweh. 
\p
\v 15 Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying, 
\v 16 You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take
another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:
\v 17 and join them for you to one another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.
\p
\v 18 When the children of your people shall speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?
\v 19 tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the
tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall
be one in my hand. 
\v 20 The sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.
\v 21 Say to them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they are
gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:
\v 22 and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they
shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;
\v 23 neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their
transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so
shall they be my people, and I will be their God. 
\p
\v 24 My servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my ordinances,
and observe my statutes, and do them. 
\v 25 They shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers lived; and they shall dwell
therein, they, and their children, and their children’s children, forever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.
\v 26 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them,
and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary among them forever more.
\v 27 My tent also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\v 28 The nations shall know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary shall be among them forever more.
\c 38  
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, 
\v 2 Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against
him, 
\v 3 and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I am against you, Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
\v 4 and I will turn you around, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, with all your army, horses and
horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler and shield, all of them handling swords;
\v 5 Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
\v 6 Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes; even many
peoples with you. 
\p
\v 7 Be prepared, yes, prepare yourself, you, and all your companies who are assembled to you, and be a guard to them.
\v 8 After many days you shall be visited: in the latter years you shall come into the land that is brought back from the
sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, on the mountains of Israel, which have been a continual waste; but it is brought
out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely, all of them. 
\v 9 You shall ascend, you shall come like a storm, you shall be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your hordes, and
many peoples with you. 
\p
\v 10 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: It shall happen in that day, that things shall come into your mind, and you shall devise an
evil device: 
\v 11 and you shall say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell securely,
all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;
\v 12 to take the plunder and to take the prey; to turn your hand against the waste places that are inhabited, and against the
people who are gathered out of the nations, who have gotten livestock and goods, who dwell in the middle of the earth.
\v 13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions of it, shall tell you, Have you come to take
the plunder? have you assembled your company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods,
to take great plunder? 
\p
\v 14 Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and tell Gog, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: In that day when my people Israel dwells
securely, shall you not know it? 
\v 15 You shall come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you, and many peoples with you, all of them
riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army; 
\v 16 and you shall come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall happen in the latter days, that I
will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, Gog, before their eyes.
\p
\v 17 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Are you he of whom I spoke in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied
in those days for years that I would bring you against them? 
\v 18 It shall happen in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, says the Lord Yahweh, that my wrath shall
come up into my nostrils. 
\v 19 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath I have spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the
land of Israel; 
\v 20 so that the fish of the sea, and the birds of the sky, and the animals of the field, and all creeping things who creep on
the earth, and all the men who are on the surface of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown
down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
\v 21 I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains, says the Lord Yahweh: every man’s sword shall be against his
brother. 
\v 22 With pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him; and I will rain on him, and on his hordes, and on the
many peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower, and great hailstones, fire, and sulfur.
\v 23 I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know
that I am Yahweh. 
\c 39  
\p
\v 1 You, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I am against you, Gog, prince of Rosh,
Meshech, and Tubal: 
\v 2 and I will turn you around, and will lead you on, and will cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and
I will bring you on the mountains of Israel; 
\v 3 and I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.
\v 4 You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all your hordes, and the peoples who are with you: I will give you to
the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the animals of the field to be devoured.
\v 5 You shall fall on the open field; for I have spoken it, says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 6 I will send a fire on Magog, and on those who dwell securely in the islands; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 7 My holy name will I make known among my people Israel; neither will I allow my holy name to be profaned any more: and the
nations shall know that I am Yahweh, the Holy One in Israel. 
\v 8 Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord Yahweh; this is the day about which I have spoken.
\p
\v 9 Those who dwell in the cities of Israel shall go out, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields
and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the war clubs, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years;
\v 10 so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of
the weapons; and they shall plunder those who plundered them, and rob those who robbed them, says the Lord Yahweh.
\p
\v 11 It shall happen in that day, that I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of those who pass through
on the east of the sea; and it shall stop those who pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they
shall call it The valley of Hamon Gog. 
\p
\v 12 Seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.
\v 13 Yes, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified,
says the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 14 They shall set apart men of continual employment, who shall pass through the land, and, with those who pass through,
those who bury those who remain on the surface of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.
\v 15 Those who pass through the land shall pass through; and when any sees a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it,
until the undertakers have buried it in the valley of Hamon Gog.
\v 16 Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
\p
\v 17 You, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh: Speak to the birds of every sort, and to every animal of the field, Assemble
yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice on
the mountains of Israel, that you may eat meat and drink blood. 
\v 18 You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats,
of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan. 
\v 19 You shall eat fat until you be full, and drink blood until you are drunk, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for
you. 
\v 20 You shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, says the Lord Yahweh.
\p
\v 21 I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I
have laid on them. 
\v 22 So the house of Israel shall know that I am Yahweh their God, from that day and forward.
\v 23 The nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against
me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.
\v 24 According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did I to them; and I hid my face from them.
\p
\v 25 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of
Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name. 
\v 26 They shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses by which they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell
securely in their land, and no one shall make them afraid; 
\v 27 when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them
in the sight of many nations. 
\v 28 They shall know that I am Yahweh their God, in that I caused them to go into captivity among the nations, and have
gathered them to their own land; and I will leave none of them any more there;
\v 29 neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured out my Spirit on the house of Israel, says the Lord
Yahweh. 
\c 40  
\p
\v 1 In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth
year after that the city was struck, in the same day, Yahweh’s hand was on me, and he brought me there.
\v 2 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, whereon was as it
were the frame of a city on the south. 
\v 3 He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax
in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. 
\v 4 The man said to me, Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I shall show
you; for, to the intent that I may show them to you, you are brought here: declare all that you see to the house of Israel.
\p
\v 5 Behold, a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six
cubits\f + A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46
centimeters.\f* long, of a cubit and a hand width each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height,
one reed. 
\p
\v 6 Then came he to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps: and he measured the threshold of the gate,
one reed wide; and the other threshold, one reed wide. 
\v 7 Every lodge was one reed long, and one reed wide; and between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by
the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed. 
\p
\v 8 He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.
\v 9 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the
house. 
\p
\v 10 The lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the
posts had one measure on this side and on that side. 
\v 11 He measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;
\v 12 and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits
on this side, and six cubits on that side. 
\v 13 He measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits; door against
door. 
\v 14 He made also posts, sixty cubits; and the court reached to the posts, around the gate.
\v 15 From the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.
\v 16 There were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate all around, and likewise to the arches; and
windows were around inward; and on each post were palm trees. 
\p
\v 17 Then brought he me into the outer court; and behold, there were rooms and a pavement, made for the court all around:
thirty rooms were on the pavement. 
\v 18 The pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.
\v 19 Then he measured the width from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred
cubits, both on the east and on the north. 
\p
\v 20 The gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured its length and its width.
\v 21 The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of
the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the width twenty-five cubits.
\v 22 The windows of it, and its arches, and the palm trees of it, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward
the east; and they went up to it by seven steps; and its arches were before them.
\v 23 There was a gate to the inner court facing the other gate, on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to
gate one hundred cubits. 
\p
\v 24 He led me toward the south; and behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured its posts and its arches according to
these measurements. 
\v 25 There were windows in it and in its arches all around, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width
twenty-five cubits. 
\v 26 There were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them; and it had palm trees, one on this side, and
another on that side, on its posts. 
\v 27 There was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred
cubits. 
\p
\v 28 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measurements;
\v 29 and its lodges, and its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements: and there were windows in it and in its
arches all around; it was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide.
\v 30 There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long, and five cubits wide.
\v 31 The arches of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees were on its posts: and the ascent to it had eight steps.
\p
\v 32 He brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measurements;
\v 33 and its lodges, and its posts, and its arches, according to these measurements: and there were windows therein and in its
arches all around; it was fifty cubits long, and twenty-five cubits wide.
\v 34 The arches of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees were on its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the
ascent to it had eight steps. 
\p
\v 35 He brought me to the north gate: and he measured it according to these measurements;
\v 36 its lodges, its posts, and its arches: and there were windows therein all around; the length was fifty cubits, and the
width twenty-five cubits. 
\v 37 The posts of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees were on its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the
ascent to it had eight steps. 
\p
\v 38 A room with its door was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt offering.
\v 39 In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, on which to kill the burnt offering,
the sin offering, and the trespass offering. 
\v 40 On the one side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other
side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables. 
\v 41 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they killed
the sacrifices. 
\v 42 There were four tables for the burnt offering, of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and
one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
\v 43 The hooks, a hand width long, were fastened within all around: and on the tables was the meat of the offering.
\p
\v 44 Outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and
their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
\v 45 He said to me, This room, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the house;
\v 46 and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the duty of the altar: these are the
sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him.
\v 47 He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits wide, square; and the altar was before the house.
\p
\v 48 Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five
cubits on that side: and the width of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
\v 49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; even by the steps by which they went up to it:
and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.
\c 41  
\p
\v 1 He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits wide on the one side, and six cubits wide on the other
side, which was the width of the tent. 
\v 2 The width of the entrance was ten cubits;\f + A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a
man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.\f* and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five
cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits.
\p
\v 3 Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the width of
the entrance, seven cubits. 
\v 4 He measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said to me, This is the
most holy place. 
\p
\v 5 Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side room, four cubits, all around the house on
every side. 
\v 6 The side rooms were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged
to the house for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported, and not penetrate the wall of the house.
\v 7 The side rooms were wider on the higher levels, because the walls were narrower at the higher levels. Therefore the width
of the house increased upward; and so one went up from the lowest level to the highest through the middle level.
\p
\v 8 I saw also that the house had a raised base all around: the foundations of the side rooms were a full reed of six great
cubits. 
\v 9 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side rooms, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the
place of the side rooms that belonged to the house. 
\v 10 Between the rooms was a width of twenty cubits around the house on every side.
\v 11 The doors of the side rooms were toward an open area that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward
the south. The width of the open area was five cubits all around.
\p
\v 12 The building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the
building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.
\p
\v 13 So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred
cubits long; 
\v 14 also the width of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, one hundred cubits.
\p
\v 15 He measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back, and its galleries on the one side
and on the other side, one hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
\v 16 the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, over against the threshold, with
wood ceilings all around, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),
\v 17 to the space above the door, even to the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall all around inside and outside, by
measure. 
\v 18 It was made with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;
\v 19 so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm
tree on the other side. It was made like this through all the house all around:
\v 20 from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.
\p
\v 21 As for the temple, the door posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, its appearance was as the
appearance of the temple. 
\v 22 The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls, were
of wood: and he said to me, This is the table that is before Yahweh.
\v 23 The temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 
\v 24 The doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves: two for the one door, and two leaves for the other.
\v 25 There were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made on the walls; and there
was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside. 
\v 26 There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the
side rooms of the house, and the thresholds. 
\c 42  
\p
\v 1 Then he brought me out into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the room that was over
against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.
\v 2 Before the length of one hundred cubits\f + A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a
man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.\f* was the north door, and the width was fifty cubits.
\v 3 Over against the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the
outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third floor. 
\v 4 Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits’ width inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.
\v 5 Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middle, in the
building. 
\v 6 For they were in three stories, and they didn’t have pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the uppermost was set
back more than the lowest and the middle from the ground. 
\v 7 The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, its length was fifty cubits.
\v 8 For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and behold, before the temple were one hundred
cubits. 
\v 9 From under these rooms was the entry on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.
\p
\v 10 In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were
rooms. 
\v 11 The way before them was like the appearance of the rooms which were toward the north; according to their length so was
their width: and all their exits were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
\v 12 According to the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly
before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them. 
\p
\v 13 Then he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms, which are before the separate place, they are the holy rooms,
where the priests who are near to Yahweh shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the
meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.
\v 14 When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay
their garments in which they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that
which is for the people. 
\p
\v 15 Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the
east, and measured it all around. 
\v 16 He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed all around.
\v 17 He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed all around.
\v 18 He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\v 19 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
\v 20 He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall around it, the length five hundred, and the width five hundred, to make a
separation between that which was holy and that which was common.
\c 43  
\p
\v 1 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east.
\v 2 Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and
the earth shined with his glory. 
\v 3 It was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to
destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
\v 4 Yahweh’s glory came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.
\v 5 The Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, Yahweh’s glory filled the house.
\p
\v 6 I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man stood by me.
\v 7 He said to me, Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell among
the children of Israel forever. The house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their
prostitution, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places;
\v 8 in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door post beside my door post, and there was a wall between
me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: therefore I have consumed them
in my anger. 
\v 9 Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell among them
forever. 
\p
\v 10 You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them
measure the pattern. 
\v 11 If they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its exits,
and its entrances, and all its forms, and all its ordinances, and all its forms, and all its laws; and write it in their sight;
that they may keep the whole form of it, and all its ordinances, and do them.
\p
\v 12 This is the law of the house: on the top of the mountain the whole limit around it shall be most holy. Behold, this is
the law of the house. 
\p
\v 13 These are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit\f + A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger
to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.\f* is a cubit and a hand width): the bottom shall be a
cubit, and the width a cubit, and its border around its edge a span;\f + A span is the length from the tip of a man’s thumb to
the tip of his little finger when his hand is stretched out (about half a cubit, or 9 inches, or 22.8
cm.)\f* and this shall be the base of the altar. 
\v 14 From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the lesser ledge
to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the width a cubit.
\v 15 The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.
\v 16 The altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in its four sides.
\v 17 The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides; and the border about it shall be half a
cubit; and its bottom shall be a cubit around; and its steps shall look toward the east.
\p
\v 18 He said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall
make it, to offer burnt offerings on it, and to sprinkle blood on it.
\v 19 You shall give to the priests the Levites who are of the offspring\f + or,
seed\f* of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me, says the Lord Yahweh, a young bull for a sin offering.
\v 20 You shall take of its blood, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border
all around: thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.
\v 21 You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside of
the sanctuary. 
\p
\v 22 On the second day you shall offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as
they cleansed it with the bull. 
\v 23 When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull without defect, and a ram out of the flock without
defect. 
\v 24 You shall bring them near to Yahweh, and the priests shall cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt
offering to Yahweh. 
\p
\v 25 Seven days you shall prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bull, and a ram out of
the flock, without defect. 
\v 26 Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.
\v 27 When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt
offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord Yahweh.
\c 44  
\p
\v 1 Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looks toward the east; and it was shut.
\v 2 Yahweh said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Yahweh, the
God of Israel, has entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.
\v 3 As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Yahweh; he shall enter by the way of the porch of
the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same. 
\p
\v 4 Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and behold, Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s
house: and I fell on my face. 
\p
\v 5 Yahweh said to me, Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I tell you concerning
all the ordinances of Yahweh’s house, and all its laws; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit of the
sanctuary. 
\v 6 You shall tell the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: you house of Israel, let it suffice
you of all your abominations, 
\v 7 in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to
profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add to all your
abominations. 
\v 8 You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.
\v 9 Thus says the Lord Yahweh, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary,
of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel. 
\p
\v 10 But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear
their iniquity. 
\v 11 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house:
they shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
\v 12 Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel;
therefore I have lifted up my hand against them, says the Lord Yahweh, and they shall bear their iniquity.
\v 13 They shall not come near to me, to execute the office of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to the
things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
\v 14 Yet will I make them performers of the duty of the house, for all its service, and for all that shall be done therein.
\p
\v 15 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who performed the duty of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went
astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me; and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the
blood, says the Lord Yahweh: 
\v 16 they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my
instruction. 
\p
\v 17 It shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no
wool shall come on them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
\v 18 They shall have linen tires on their heads, and shall have linen breeches on their waists; they shall not clothe
themselves with anything that makes them sweat. 
\v 19 When they go out into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in
which they minister, and lay them in the holy rooms; and they shall put on other garments, that they not sanctify the people
with their garments. 
\p
\v 20 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor allow their locks to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their
heads. 
\v 21 Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
\v 22 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her who is put away; but they shall take virgins of the
offspring\f + or, seed\f* of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.
\v 23 They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean
and the clean. 
\p
\v 24 In a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to my ordinances shall they judge it: and they shall keep my laws
and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall make my Sabbaths holy.
\p
\v 25 They shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for
brother, or for sister who has had no husband, they may defile themselves.
\v 26 After he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days.
\v 27 In the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin
offering, says the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 28 They shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and you shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their
possession. 
\v 29 They shall eat the meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every devoted thing in Israel
shall be theirs. 
\v 30 The first of all the first fruits of every thing, and every offering of everything, of all your offerings, shall be for
the priest: you shall also give to the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on your house.
\v 31 The priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself, or is torn, whether it is bird or animal.
\c 45  
\p
\v 1 Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an offering to Yahweh, a holy portion of
the land; the length shall be the length of twenty-five thousand reeds, and the width shall be ten thousand: it shall be holy
in all its border all around. 
\v 2 Of this there shall be a five hundred by five hundred square for the holy place; and fifty
cubits\f + A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46
centimeters.\f* for its suburbs all around. 
\v 3 Of this measure you shall measure a length of twenty-five thousand, and a width of ten thousand: and in it shall be the
sanctuary, which is most holy. 
\v 4 It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister
to Yahweh; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.
\v 5 Twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in width, shall be to the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a
possession to themselves, for twenty rooms. 
\p
\v 6 You shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand wide, and twenty-five thousand long, side by side with the
offering of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
\p
\v 7 What is for the prince shall be on the one side and on the other side of the holy offering and of the possession of the
city, in front of the holy offering and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side
eastward; and in length answerable to one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.
\v 8 In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall
give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes. 
\p
\v 9 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Let it suffice you, princes of Israel: remove violence and plunder, and execute justice and
righteousness; dispossessing my people, says the Lord Yahweh. 
\v 10 You shall have just balances, and a just ephah,\f + 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a
bushel\f* and a just bath. 
\v 11 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain one tenth of a
homer,\f + 1 homer is about 220 liters or 6 bushels\f* and the ephah one tenth of a homer: its measure shall be after the
homer. 
\v 12 The shekel\f + A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.\f* shall be twenty
gerahs.\f + a gerah is about 0.5 grams or about 7.7 grains\f* Twenty shekels plus twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels
shall be your mina.\f + A mina is about 600 grams or 1.3 U. S. pounds.\f*
\p
\v 13 This is the offering that you shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and you shall give the sixth
part of an ephah from a homer of barley; 
\v 14 and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, one tenth of a bath out of the cor, which is ten baths, even a homer;
(for ten baths are a homer;)\f + 1 cor is the same as 1 homer in volume, and is about 211 liters, 55.9 gallons, or 6 bushels 1
bath is about 21.1 liters, 5.59 gallons, or 2.4 pecks.\f* 
\v 15 and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel—for a meal offering, and for a
burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Lord Yahweh.
\v 16 All the people of the land shall give to this offering for the prince in Israel.
\v 17 It shall be the prince’s part to give the burnt offerings, and the meal offerings, and the drink offerings, in the
feasts, and on the new moons, and on the Sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin
offering, and the meal offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
\p
\v 18 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: In the first month, in the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without defect;
and you shall cleanse the sanctuary. 
\v 19 The priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it on the door posts of the house, and on the four
corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court.
\v 20 So you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who errs, and for him who is simple: so you shall make
atonement for the house. 
\p
\v 21 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened
bread shall be eaten. 
\v 22 On that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.
\v 23 The seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to Yahweh, seven bulls and seven rams without defect daily
the seven days; and a male goat daily for a sin offering. 
\v 24 He shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah\f + 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a
bushel\f* for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
\p
\v 25 In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days; according to
the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meal offering, and according to the oil.
\c 46  
\p
\v 1 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but
on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
\v 2 The prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the
priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he
shall go out; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. 
\v 3 The people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.
\v 4 The burnt offering that the prince shall offer to Yahweh shall be on the Sabbath day six lambs without defect and a ram
without defect; 
\v 5 and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin
of oil to an ephah.\f + 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a
bushel\f* 
\v 6 On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without defect, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without
defect: 
\v 7 and he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bull, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he
is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 
\v 8 When the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go out by its way.
\p
\v 9 But when the people of the land shall come before Yahweh in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north
gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he who enters by the way of the south gate shall go out by the
way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go out straight before him.
\v 10 The prince shall go in with them when they go in; and when they go out, he shall go out.
\p
\v 11 In the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering shall be an ephah
\f + 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel\f* for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able
to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 
\v 12 When the prince shall prepare a freewill offering, a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to Yahweh,
one shall open for him the gate that looks toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as
he does on the Sabbath day: then he shall go out; and after his going out one shall shut the gate.
\p
\v 13 You shall prepare a lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering to Yahweh daily: morning by morning you shall
prepare it. 
\v 14 You shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an
ephah,\f + 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel\f* and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine
flour; a meal offering to Yahweh continually by a perpetual ordinance.
\v 15 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.
\p
\v 16 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: If the prince give a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his
sons; it is their possession by inheritance. 
\v 17 But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall
return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.
\v 18 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give
inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people not be scattered every man from his possession.
\p
\v 19 Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms for the priests, which
looked toward the north: and behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward.
\v 20 He said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they
shall bake the meal offering; that they not bring them out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.
\p
\v 21 Then he brought me out into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold, in every
corner of the court there was a court. 
\v 22 In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty
cubits\f + A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46
centimeters.\f* long and thirty wide: these four in the corners were of one measure.
\v 23 There was a wall around in them, around the four, and boiling places were made under the walls all around.
\v 24 Then he said to me, These are the boiling houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the
people. 
\c 47  
\p
\v 1 He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward;
(for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on
the south of the altar. 
\v 2 Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way
of the gate that looks toward the east; and behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
\p
\v 3 When the man went out eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand
cubits,\f + A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46
centimeters.\f* and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.
\v 4 Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured
one thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the waist.
\v 5 Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to
swim in, a river that could not be passed through. 
\v 6 He said to me, Son of man, have you seen? 
\p Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.
\v 7 Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
\v 8 Then he said to me, These waters flow out toward the eastern region, and will go down into the Arabah; and they will go
toward the sea; and flow into the sea which will be made to flow out; and the waters will be healed.
\v 9 It shall happen, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, shall live; and there
shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters have come there, and the waters of the sea shall be healed, and
everything shall live wherever the river comes. 
\v 10 It shall happen, that fishermen shall stand by it: from En Gedi even to En Eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of
nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
\v 11 But the miry places of it, and its marshes, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt.
\v 12 By the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither,
neither shall its fruit fail: it shall produce new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and its
fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for healing. 
\p
\v 13 Thus says the Lord Yahweh: This shall be the border, by which you shall divide the land for inheritance according to the
twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions. 
\v 14 You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you for
inheritance. 
\p
\v 15 This shall be the border of the land: 
\p On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;
\v 16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer Hatticon, which is by
the border of Hauran. 
\v 17 The border from the sea, shall be Hazar Enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of
Hamath. This is the north side. 
\p
\v 18 The east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border
to the east sea you shall measure. This is the east side. 
\p
\v 19 The south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth Kadesh, to the brook, to the great sea.
This is the south side southward. 
\p
\v 20 The west side shall be the great sea, from the south border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the
west side. 
\p
\v 21 So you shall divide this land to you according to the tribes of Israel.
\v 22 It shall happen, that you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you and to the aliens who live among you, who
shall father children among you; and they shall be to you as the native-born among the children of Israel; they shall have
inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. 
\v 23 It shall happen, that in what tribe the stranger lives, there you shall give him his inheritance, says the Lord Yahweh.
\c 48  
\p
\v 1 Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar Enan
at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath, (and they shall have their sides east and west), Dan, one portion.
\p
\v 2 By the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side, Asher, one portion.
\p
\v 3 By the border of Asher, from the east side even to the west side, Naphtali, one portion.
\p
\v 4 By the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side, Manasseh, one portion.
\p
\v 5 By the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side, Ephraim, one portion.
\p
\v 6 By the border of Ephraim, from the east side even to the west side, Reuben, one portion.
\p
\v 7 By the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side, Judah, one portion.
\p
\v 8 By the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side, shall be the offering which you shall offer, twenty-five
thousand reeds in width, and in length as one of the portions, from the east side to the west side: and the sanctuary shall be
in the middle of it. 
\p
\v 9 The offering that you shall offer to Yahweh shall be twenty-five thousand reeds in length, and ten thousand in width.
\v 10 For these, even for the priests, shall be the holy offering: toward the north twenty-five thousand in length, and toward
the west ten thousand in width, and toward the east ten thousand in width, and toward the south twenty-five thousand in length:
and the sanctuary of Yahweh shall be in the middle of it. 
\v 11 It shall be for the priests who are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, who have kept my instruction, who didn’t go astray
when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
\v 12 It shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.
\p
\v 13 Answerable to the border of the priests, the Levites shall have twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in
width: all the length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the width ten thousand.
\v 14 They shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy to
Yahweh. 
\p
\v 15 The five thousand that are left in the width, in front of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use, for the
city, for dwelling and for suburbs; and the city shall be in the middle of it.
\v 16 These shall be its measurements: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five
hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
\v 17 The city shall have suburbs: toward the north two hundred fifty, and toward the south two hundred fifty, and toward the
east two hundred fifty, and toward the west two hundred fifty. 
\v 18 The remainder in the length, answerable to the holy offering, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward;
and it shall be answerable to the holy offering; and its increase shall be for food to those who labor in the city.
\v 19 Those who labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it.
\v 20 All the offering shall be a square of twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand: you shall offer it as a holy
offering, with the possession of the city. 
\p
\v 21 The remainder shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy offering and of the possession of the
city; in front of the twenty-five thousand of the offering toward the east border, and westward in front of the twenty-five
thousand toward the west border, answerable to the portions, it shall be for the prince: and the holy offering and the
sanctuary of the house shall be in the middle of it. 
\v 22 Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the middle of that which is
the prince’s, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, it shall be for the prince.
\p
\v 23 As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, Benjamin, one portion.
\p
\v 24 By the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, Simeon, one portion.
\p
\v 25 By the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, Issachar, one portion.
\p
\v 26 By the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, Zebulun, one portion.
\p
\v 27 By the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side, Gad, one portion.
\p
\v 28 By the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh,
to the brook, to the great sea. 
\p
\v 29 This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several
portions, says the Lord Yahweh. 
\p
\v 30 These are the exits of the city: On the north side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure;
\v 31 and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates northward: the gate of Reuben,
one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one. 
\p
\v 32 At the east side four thousand and five hundred reeds, and three gates: even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of
Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one. 
\p
\v 33 At the south side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure, and three gates: the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of
Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one. 
\p
\v 34 At the west side four thousand and five hundred reeds, with their three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher,
one; the gate of Naphtali, one. 
\p
\v 35 It shall be eighteen thousand reeds around: and the name of the city from that day shall be, Yahweh is there.
