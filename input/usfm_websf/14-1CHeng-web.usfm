descended from Ham.

there, and they destroyed them utterly to this day, and lived in their place; because there was pasture there for their flocks.

\c 5  
\p
\v 1 The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (for he was the firstborn; but, because he defiled his father’s couch, his
birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel; and the genealogy is not to be listed according to the
birthright. 
\v 2 For Judah prevailed above his brothers, and from him came the prince; but the birthright was Joseph’s)—
\v 3 the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
\v 4 The sons of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,
\v 5 Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son,

\v 7 His brothers by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was listed: the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,
\v 8 and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who lived in Aroer, even to Nebo and Baal Meon;
\v 9 and he lived eastward even to the entrance of the wilderness from the river Euphrates, because their livestock were
multiplied in the land of Gilead. 
\p
\v 10 In the days of Saul, they made war with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand; and they lived in their tents throughout
all the land east of Gilead. 
\v 11 The sons of Gad lived over against them, in the land of Bashan to Salecah:
\v 12 Joel the chief, Shapham the second, Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan.
\v 13 Their brothers of their fathers’ houses: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber, seven.
\v 14 These were the sons of Abihail, the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of
Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz; 
\v 15 Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of their fathers’ houses.
\v 16 They lived in Gilead in Bashan, and in its towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, as far as their borders.
\v 17 All these were listed by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
\p
\v 18 The sons of Reuben, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and
to shoot with bow, and skillful in war, were forty-four thousand seven hundred sixty, that were able to go out to war.
\v 19 They made war with the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab.
\v 20 They were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all who were with them; for they
cried to God in the battle, and he was answered them, because they put their trust in him.
\v 21 They took away their livestock; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred fifty thousand, and of donkeys
two thousand, and of men one hundred thousand. 
\v 22 For many fell slain, because the war was of God. They lived in their place until the captivity.
\v 23 The children of the half-tribe of Manasseh lived in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baal Hermon, Senir, and Mount
Hermon. 
\v 24 These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: even Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty
men of valor, famous men, heads of their fathers’ houses. 
\v 25 They trespassed against the God of their fathers, and played the prostitute after the gods of the peoples of the land,
whom God destroyed before them. 
\v 26 So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria,
and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah,
Habor, Hara, and to the river of Gozan, to this day.

\p
\v 1 So all Israel were listed by genealogies; and behold,\f + “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe,
see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.\f* they are written in the book of the kings of Israel. Judah was carried
away captive to Babylon for their disobedience. 
\v 2 Now the first inhabitants who lived in their possessions in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the
temple servants. 
\v 3 In Jerusalem lived of the children of Judah, of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh:
\v 4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of Judah.

\p
\v 17 The porters: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brothers (Shallum was the chief),
\v 18 who previously served in the king’s gate eastward. They were the porters for the camp of the children of Levi.
\v 19 Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of his father’s house, the Korahites,
were over the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent. Their fathers had been over Yahweh’s camp, keepers of
the entry. 
\v 20 Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past, and Yahweh was with him.
\v 21 Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the Tent of Meeting.
\v 22 All these who were chosen to be porters in the thresholds were two hundred twelve. These were listed by genealogy in
their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their office of trust.
\v 23 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of Yahweh’s house, even the house of the tent, by wards.
\v 24 On the four sides were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.
\v 25 Their brothers, in their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them:
\v 26 for the four chief porters, who were Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the rooms and over the treasuries
in God’s house. 
\v 27 They stayed around God’s house, because that duty was on them; and to their duty was its opening morning by morning.
\v 28 Certain of them were in charge of the vessels of service; for these were brought in by count, and these were taken out by
count. 
\v 29 Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, over the fine flour, the
wine, the oil, the frankincense, and the spices. 
\p
\v 30 Some of the sons of the priests prepared the mixing of the spices.
\v 31 Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the office of trust over the things
that were baked in pans. 
\v 32 Some of their brothers, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the show bread, to prepare it every Sabbath.
\v 33 These are the singers, heads of fathers’ households of the Levites, who lived in the rooms and were free from other
service; for they were employed in their work day and night. 
\v 34 These were heads of fathers’ households of the Levites, throughout their generations, chief men. These lived at
Jerusalem. 
\v 35 Jeiel the father of Gibeon, whose wife’s name was Maacah, lived in Gibeon with
\v 36 his firstborn son Abdon, Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, 
\v 37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. 
\v 38 Mikloth became the father of Shimeam. They also lived with their brothers in Jerusalem, near their brothers.
\v 39 Ner became the father of Kish. Kish became the father of Saul. Saul became the father of Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab,
and Eshbaal. 
\v 40 The son of Jonathan was Merib Baal. Merib Baal became the father of Micah.
\v 41 The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. 
\v 42 Ahaz became the father of Jarah. Jarah became the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. Zimri became the father of
Moza. 
\v 43 Moza became the father of Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, and Azel his son.
\v 44 Azel had six sons, whose names are these: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of
Azel. 
\c 10  
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on
Mount Gilboa. 
\v 2 The Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and
Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
\v 3 The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers.
\v 4 Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and
abuse me.” 
\p But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and fell on it.
\v 5 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died.
\v 6 So Saul died with his three sons; and all his house died together.
\v 7 When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned
their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
\p
\v 8 On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
\v 9 They stripped him, and took his head and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around, to carry the
news to their idols, and to the people. 
\v 10 They put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.
\v 11 When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
\v 12 all the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and
buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
\v 13 So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh, because of Yahweh’s word, which he didn’t keep; and also
because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit, to inquire,
\v 14 and didn’t inquire of Yahweh. Therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.
\c 11  
\p
\v 1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
\v 2 In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh your God said to you, ‘You
shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.’”
\p
\v 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and
they anointed David king over Israel, according to Yahweh’s word by Samuel.
\v 4 David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (also called Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.
\v 5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. The
same is David’s city. 
\v 6 David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and
was made chief. 
\v 7 David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it David’s city.
\v 8 He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
\v 9 David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh of Armies was with him.
\v 10 Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together
with all Israel, to make him king, according to Yahweh’s word concerning Israel.
\p
\v 11 This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he
lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.
\v 12 After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
\v 13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of
ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
\v 14 They stood in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory.
\v 15 Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines
were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
\v 16 David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time.
\v 17 David longed, and said, “Oh that one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!”
\p
\v 18 The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate,
and took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink any of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,
\v 19 and said, “My God forbid me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in
jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.
\p
\v 20 Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed
them, and had a name among the three. 
\v 21 Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain; however he wasn’t included in the three.
\v 22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel
of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day.
\v 23 He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits\f + A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to
the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters. Therefore this Egyptian was bout 7 feet and 6 inches or 2.28
meters tall.\f* high. In the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, plucked
the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.
\v 24 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.
\v 25 Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three; and David set him over his guard.
\p
\v 26 The mighty men of the armies also include Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\v 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 
\v 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
\v 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 
\v 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,
\v 31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
\v 32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 
\v 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 
\v 34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite,
\v 35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,
\v 36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 
\v 37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, 
\v 38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, 
\v 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
\v 40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
\v 41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 
\v 42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,
\v 43 Hanan the son of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 
\v 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
\v 45 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
\v 46 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
\v 47 Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. 
\c 12  
\p
\v 1 Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag, while he was a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish. They were among the
mighty men, his helpers in war. 
\v 2 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from
the bow. They were of Saul’s relatives of the tribe of Benjamin.
\v 3 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah;
Jehu the Anathothite; 
\v 4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty and a leader of the thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad the
Gederathite; 
\v 5 Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Haruphite;
\v 6 Elkanah, Isshiah Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites;
\v 7 and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 
\v 8 Some Gadites joined David in the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, who could handle
shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains:
\v 9 Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 
\v 11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
\v 12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
\v 13 Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh. 
\v 14 These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army: he who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest to one
thousand. 
\v 15 These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight
all who lived in the valleys, both toward the east and toward the west.
\v 16 Some of the children of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.
\v 17 David went out to meet them, and answered them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united
with you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers
see this and rebuke it.” 
\v 18 Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, “We are yours, David, and on your side, you son
of Jesse. Peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.” Then David received them, and made
them captains of the band. 
\v 19 Some of Manasseh also joined David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle; but they didn’t help them;
for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul to the jeopardy
of our heads.” 
\p
\v 20 As he went to Ziklag, some from Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai,
captains of thousands who were of Manasseh. 
\v 21 They helped David against the band of rovers; for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army.
\v 22 For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like God’s army.
\p
\v 23 These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of
Saul to him, according to Yahweh’s word. 
\v 24 The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand eight hundred, armed for war.
\v 25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war, seven thousand one hundred.
\v 26 Of the children of Levi four thousand six hundred. 
\v 27 Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron; and with him were three thousand seven hundred,
\v 28 and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father’s house twenty-two captains.
\v 29 Of the children of Benjamin, Saul’s relatives, three thousand: for until then, the greatest part of them had kept their
allegiance to Saul’s house. 
\v 30 Of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers’ houses.
\v 31 Of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king.
\v 32 Of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their heads were
two hundred; and all their brothers were at their command. 
\v 33 Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, with all kinds of instruments of
war, fifty thousand, and who could command and were not of double heart.
\v 34 Of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand.
\v 35 Of the Danites who could set the battle in array, twenty-eight thousand six hundred.
\v 36 Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, forty thousand.
\v 37 On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all kinds of
instruments of war for the battle, one hundred twenty thousand. 
\v 38 All these were men of war, who could order the battle array, and came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king
over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.
\v 39 They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had supplied provisions for them.
\v 40 Moreover those who were near to them, as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, on camels, on
mules, and on oxen: supplies of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep in abundance; for there
was joy in Israel. 
\c 13  
\p
\v 1 David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.
\v 2 David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is of Yahweh our God, let us send word
everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that
have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us. 
\v 3 Also, let us again bring the ark of our God back to us; for we didn’t seek it in the days of Saul.”
\p
\v 4 All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
\v 5 So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring God’s
ark from Kiriath Jearim. 
\p
\v 6 David went up with all Israel to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there God
Yahweh’s ark that sits above the cherubim, that is called by the Name.
\v 7 They carried God’s ark on a new cart, and brought it out of Abinadab’s house; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
\v 8 David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, with harps, with stringed instruments, with
tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
\v 9 When they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
\v 10 Yahweh’s anger burned against Uzza, and he struck him, because he put his hand on the ark; and he died there before God.
\v 11 David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken out against Uzza. He called that place Perez Uzza, to this day.
\v 12 David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring God’s ark home to me?”
\v 13 So David didn’t move the ark with him into David’s city, but carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house.
\v 14 God’s ark remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months; and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom’s house and all
that he had. 
\c 14  
\p
\v 1 Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.
\v 2 David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people
Israel’s sake. 
\v 3 David took more wives at Jerusalem, and David became the father of more sons and daughters.
\v 4 These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
\v 5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
\v 6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
\v 7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. 
\p
\v 8 When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and
David heard of it, and went out against them. 
\v 9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 10 David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?”
\p Yahweh said to him, “Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.”
\p
\v 11 So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like
waters breaking out. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal
Perazim.\f + “Baal Perazim” means “The Lord who breaks out”.\f* 
\v 12 They left their gods there; and David gave a command, and they were burned with fire.
\p
\v 13 The Philistines made a another raid in the valley. 
\v 14 David inquired again of God; and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them
opposite the mulberry trees. 
\v 15 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle; for God has gone out before
you to strike the army of the Philistines.” 
\p
\v 16 David did as God commanded him; and they attacked the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
\v 17 The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.
\c 15  
\p
\v 1 David made himself houses in David’s city; and he prepared a place for God’s ark, and pitched a tent for it.
\v 2 Then David said, “No one ought to carry God’s ark but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to carry God’s ark, and to
minister to him forever.” 
\p
\v 3 David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up Yahweh’s ark to its place, which he had prepared for it.
\v 4 David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: 
\v 5 of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty;
\v 6 of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty;
\v 7 of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty;
\v 8 of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;
\v 9 of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty;
\v 10 of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve.
\v 11 David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and
Amminadab, 
\v 12 and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your
brothers, that you may bring the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, up to the place that I have prepared for it.
\v 13 For because you didn’t carry it at first, Yahweh our God broke out in anger against us, because we didn’t seek him
according to the ordinance.” 
\p
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 15 The children of the Levites bore God’s ark on their shoulders with its poles, as Moses commanded according to Yahweh’s
word. 
\v 16 David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of music, stringed
instruments, harps, and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up their voices with joy.
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of
Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
\v 18 and with them their brothers of the second rank, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah,
Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.
\v 19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud;
\v 20 and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;
\v 21 and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to
lead. 
\v 22 Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the singing. He taught the singers, because he was skillful.
\v 23 Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
\v 24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before God’s ark;
and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
\p
\v 25 So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up out of the
house of Obed-Edom with joy. 
\v 26 When God helped the Levites who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
\v 27 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the
choir master with the singers; and David had an ephod of linen on him.
\v 28 Thus all Israel brought the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up with shouting, with sound of the cornet, with trumpets, and with
cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps. 
\v 29 As the ark of Yahweh’s covenant came to David’s city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king
David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart. 
\c 16  
\p
\v 1 They brought in God’s ark, and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings before God. 
\v 2 When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in Yahweh’s name.
\v 3 He gave to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.
\v 4 He appointed some of the Levites to minister before Yahweh’s ark, and to commemorate, to thank, and to praise Yahweh, the
God of Israel: 
\v 5 Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and
Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;
\v 6 with Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
\p
\v 7 Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.
\q
\v 8 Oh give thanks to Yahweh. 
\q2 Call on his name. 
\q2 Make what he has done known among the peoples. 
\q
\v 9 Sing to him. 
\q2 Sing praises to him. 
\q2 Tell of all his marvelous works. 
\q
\v 10 Glory in his holy name. 
\q2 Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice. 
\q
\v 11 Seek Yahweh and his strength. 
\q2 Seek his face forever more. 
\q
\v 12 Remember his marvelous works that he has done, 
\q2 his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth, 
\q
\v 13 you offspring\f + or, seed\f* of Israel his servant, 
\q2 you children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 
\q
\v 14 He is Yahweh our God. 
\q2 His judgments are in all the earth. 
\q
\v 15 Remember his covenant forever, 
\q2 the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, 
\q2
\v 16 the covenant which he made with Abraham, 
\q2 his oath to Isaac. 
\q
\v 17 He confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute, 
\q2 and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, 
\q
\v 18 saying, “I will give you the land of Canaan, 
\q2 The lot of your inheritance,” 
\q2
\v 19 when you were but a few men in number, 
\q2 yes, very few, and foreigners were in it. 
\q
\v 20 They went about from nation to nation, 
\q2 from one kingdom to another people. 
\q
\v 21 He allowed no man to do them wrong. 
\q2 Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes, 
\q
\v 22 “Don’t touch my anointed ones! 
\q2 Do my prophets no harm!” 
\q
\v 23 Sing to Yahweh, all the earth! 
\q2 Display his salvation from day to day. 
\q
\v 24 Declare his glory among the nations, 
\q2 and his marvelous works among all the peoples. 
\q
\v 25 For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised. 
\q2 He also is to be feared above all gods. 
\q
\v 26 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, 
\q2 but Yahweh made the heavens. 
\q
\v 27 Honor and majesty are before him. 
\q2 Strength and gladness are in his place. 
\q
\v 28 Ascribe to Yahweh, you relatives of the peoples, 
\q2 ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength! 
\q
\v 29 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name. 
\q2 Bring an offering, and come before him. 
\q2 Worship Yahweh in holy array. 
\q
\v 30 Tremble before him, all the earth. 
\q2 The world also is established that it can’t be moved. 
\q
\v 31 Let the heavens be glad, 
\q2 and let the earth rejoice! 
\q2 Let them say among the nations, “Yahweh reigns!” 
\q
\v 32 Let the sea roar, and its fullness! 
\q2 Let the field exult, and all that is in it! 
\q
\v 33 Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh,
\q2 for he comes to judge the earth. 
\q
\v 34 Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, 
\q2 for his loving kindness endures forever. 
\q
\v 35 Say, “Save us, God of our salvation! 
\q2 Gather us together and deliver us from the nations, 
\q2 to give thanks to your holy name, 
\q2 to triumph in your praise.” 
\q
\v 36 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, 
\q2 from everlasting even to everlasting. 
\p All the people said, “Amen,” and praised Yahweh. 
\p
\v 37 So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, to minister before the ark continually, as
every day’s work required; 
\v 38 and Obed-Edom with their brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;
\v 39 and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before Yahweh’s tabernacle in the high place that was at Gibeon,
\v 40 to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all
that is written in Yahweh’s law, which he commanded to Israel; 
\v 41 and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh,
because his loving kindness endures forever; 
\v 42 and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for
the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate. 
\v 43 All the people departed, each man to his house; and David returned to bless his house.
\c 17  
\p
\v 1 When David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of
Yahweh’s covenant is in a tent.” 
\p
\v 2 Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.”
\p
\v 3 That same night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
\v 4 “Go and tell David my servant, ‘Yahweh says, “You shall not build me a house to dwell in;
\v 5 for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and
from one tent to another. 
\v 6 In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I
commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’
\p
\v 7 “Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following
the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel. 
\v 8 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name,
like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. 
\v 9 I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no
more. The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first,
\v 10 and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you
that Yahweh will build you a house. 
\v 11 It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your
offspring\f + or, seed\f* after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
\v 12 He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.
\v 13 I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him that
was before you; 
\v 14 but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne will be established forever.”’”
\v 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
\p
\v 16 Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you
have brought me this far? 
\v 17 This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have
respected me according to the standard of a man of high degree, Yahweh God.
\v 18 What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant.
\v 19 Yahweh, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, to make known all
these great things. 
\v 20 Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our
ears. 
\v 21 What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a
name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?
\v 22 For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.
\v 23 Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever,
and do as you have spoken. 
\v 24 Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel.
The house of David your servant is established before you.’ 
\v 25 For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage
to pray before you. 
\v 26 Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.
\v 27 Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have
blessed, and it is blessed forever.” 
\c 18  
\p
\v 1 After this, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the
Philistines. 
\v 2 He defeated Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.
\v 3 David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
\v 4 David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all
the chariot horses, but reserved of them enough for one hundred chariots.
\v 5 When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians.
\v 6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave
victory to David wherever he went. 
\v 7 David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\v 8 From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much brass, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, the
pillars, and the vessels of brass. 
\p
\v 9 When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
\v 10 he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck
him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
\v 11 King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from
Edom, from Moab, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
\v 12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
\v 13 He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.
\p
\v 14 David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness for all his people.
\v 15 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
\v 16 Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; Shavsha was scribe;
\v 17 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief officials
serving the king. 
\c 19  
\p
\v 1 After this, Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.
\v 2 David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.”
\p So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon
to Hanun, to comfort him. 
\v 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent
comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?”
\v 4 So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them
away. 
\v 5 Then some people went and told David how the men were treated. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly humiliated.
The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”
\p
\v 6 When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one
thousand talents\f + A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds, so 1000 talents is about 30 metric
tons\f* of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah.
\v 7 So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people, who came and encamped
near Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
\v 8 When David heard of it, he sent Joab with all the army of the mighty men.
\v 9 The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings who had come were by
themselves in the field. 
\v 10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose some of all the choice men of Israel,
and put them in array against the Syrians. 
\v 11 The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the
children of Ammon. 
\v 12 He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for
you, then I will help you. 
\v 13 Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that which seems good to
him.” 
\p
\v 14 So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.
\v 15 When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into
the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 16 When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and called out the Syrians who were beyond
the River,\f + or, the Euphrates River\f* with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer leading them.
\v 17 David was told that; so he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, came to them, and set the battle in
array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
\v 18 The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrian men seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen,
and also killed Shophach the captain of the army. 
\v 19 When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David, and served him. The
Syrians would not help the children of Ammon any more. 
\c 20  
\p
\v 1 At the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, Joab led out the army, and wasted the country of the
children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.
\v 2 David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of
gold,\f + A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy
ounces\f* and there were precious stones in it. It was set on David’s head, and he brought very much plunder out of the city.
\v 3 He brought out the people who were in it, and had them cut with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all
the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 4 After this, war arose at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant;
and they were subdued. 
\p
\v 5 Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the
staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
\v 6 There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each
hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant. 
\v 7 When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother killed him.
\v 8 These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
\c 21  
\p
\v 1 Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to take a census of Israel.
\v 2 David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that
I may know how many there are.” 
\p
\v 3 Joab said, “May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my
lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?”
\p
\v 4 Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, then came to
Jerusalem. 
\v 5 Joab gave up the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men
who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword.
\v 6 But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.
\p
\v 7 God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.
\v 8 David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of
your servant; for I have done very foolishly.” 
\p
\v 9 Yahweh spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying, 
\v 10 “Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”
\p
\v 11 So Gad came to David, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Take your choice:
\v 12 either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes
you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and Yahweh’s angel destroying throughout all the
borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.’”
\p
\v 13 David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into Yahweh’s hand; for his mercies are very great. Don’t let
me fall into man’s hand.” 
\p
\v 14 So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.
\v 15 God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster,
and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of
Ornan the Jebusite. 
\v 16 David lifted up his eyes, and saw Yahweh’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand
stretched out over Jerusalem. 
\p Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
\v 17 David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very
wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father’s
house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.”
\p
\v 18 Then Yahweh’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to Yahweh on the threshing
floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
\v 19 David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yahweh’s name.
\p
\v 20 Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
\v 21 As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with
his face to the ground. 
\p
\v 22 Then David said to Ornan, “Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You
shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”
\p
\v 23 Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give
the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.”
\p
\v 24 King David said to Ornan, “No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is
yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”
\p
\v 25 So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels\f + A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.32 Troy ounces, so 600 shekels was
about 6 kilograms or about 192 Troy ounces.\f* of gold by weight for the place.
\v 26 David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he
answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.
\p
\v 27 Then Yahweh commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
\v 28 At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he
sacrificed there. 
\v 29 For Yahweh’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the
high place at Gibeon. 
\v 30 But David couldn’t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of Yahweh’s angel.
\c 22  
\p
\v 1 Then David said, “This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”
\p
\v 2 David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut dressed
stones to build God’s house. 
\v 3 David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance
without weight; 
\v 4 and cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.
\v 5 David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly
magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David prepared
abundantly before his death. 
\v 6 Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 7 David said to Solomon his son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God.
\v 8 But Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ‘You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars. You shall not build a
house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.
\v 9 Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for
his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.
\v 10 He shall build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of
his kingdom over Israel for ever.’ 
\v 11 Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning
you. 
\v 12 May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh
your God. 
\v 13 Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel. Be
strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid, and don’t be dismayed. 
\v 14 Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for Yahweh’s house one hundred thousand
talents\f + A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces, so 100,000 talents is about 3 metric
tons\f* of gold, one million talents\f + about 30,000 metric tons\f* of silver, and brass and iron without weight; for it is in
abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them.
\v 15 There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are
skillful in every kind of work; 
\v 16 of the gold, the silver, the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be with you.”
\p
\v 17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
\v 18 “Isn’t Yahweh your God with you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land
into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and before his people.
\v 19 Now set your heart and your soul to follow Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to
bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for Yahweh’s name.”
\c 23  
\p
\v 1 Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
\v 2 He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
\v 3 The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight
thousand. 
\v 4 David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of Yahweh’s house, six thousand were officers and
judges, 
\v 5 four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made for giving praise.”
\p
\v 6 David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\p
\v 7 Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei. 
\v 8 The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three.
\v 9 The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan.
\v 10 The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
\v 11 Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’
house in one reckoning. 
\p
\v 12 The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
\v 13 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his
sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever.
\v 14 But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
\v 15 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 
\v 16 The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 
\v 17 The sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
\v 18 The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. 
\v 19 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\v 20 The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.
\v 21 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
\v 22 Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives.
\v 23 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 
\p
\v 24 These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those who were counted
individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of Yahweh’s house, from twenty years old
and upward. 
\v 25 For David said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.
\v 26 Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.”
\v 27 For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward.
\v 28 For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of Yahweh’s house, in the courts, and in the rooms, and
in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of God’s house;
\v 29 for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is
baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all measurements of quantity and size;
\v 30 and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening;
\v 31 and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according
to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh; 
\v 32 and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron
their brothers, for the service of Yahweh’s house. 
\c 24  
\p
\v 1 These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s
office. 
\v 3 David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in
their service. 
\v 4 There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of
the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’
houses, eight. 
\v 5 Thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of
the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
\v 6 Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, the princes,
Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites;
one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.
\v 7 Now the first lot came out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
\v 8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 
\v 9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 
\v 10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 
\v 11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, 
\v 12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 
\v 13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 
\v 14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 
\v 15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, 
\v 16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, 
\v 17 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul, 
\v 18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
\v 19 This was their ordering in their service, to come into Yahweh’s house according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron
their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded him. 
\p
\v 20 Of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
\v 21 Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. 
\v 22 Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
\v 23 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\v 24 The sons of Uzziel: Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. 
\v 25 The brother of Micah: Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
\v 26 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno.
\v 27 The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
\v 28 Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. 
\v 29 Of Kish, the son of Kish: Jerahmeel. 
\v 30 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers’ houses.
\v 31 These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech,
and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; the fathers’ households of the chief even as those
of his younger brother. 
\c 25  
\p
\v 1 Moreover, David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of
Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments, and with cymbals. The number of those who did the work
according to their service was: 
\v 2 of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah. The sons of Asaph were under the hand of Asaph, who
prophesied at the order of the king. 
\v 3 Of Jeduthun; the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of
their father Jeduthun, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh with the harp.
\v 4 Of Heman; the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti,
Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. 
\v 5 All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. God gave to Heman fourteen sons
and three daughters. 
\v 6 All these were under the hands of their father for song in Yahweh’s house, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps,
for the service of God’s house; Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king.
\v 7 The number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh, even all who were skillful, was two
hundred eighty-eight. 
\v 8 They cast lots for their offices, all alike, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the student.
\p
\v 9 Now the first lot came out for Asaph to Joseph; the second to Gedaliah, he and his brothers and sons were twelve;
\v 10 the third to Zaccur, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
\v 11 the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
\v 12 the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 13 the sixth to Bukkiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
\v 14 the seventh to Jesharelah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 15 the eighth to Jeshaiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 16 the ninth to Mattaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 17 the tenth to Shimei, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
\v 18 the eleventh to Azarel, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 19 the twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 20 for the thirteenth, Shubael, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 21 for the fourteenth, Mattithiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 22 for the fifteenth to Jeremoth, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 23 for the sixteenth to Hananiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 24 for the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 25 for the eighteenth to Hanani, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 26 for the nineteenth to Mallothi, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 27 for the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 28 for the twenty-first to Hothir, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 29 for the twenty-second to Giddalti, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 30 for the twenty-third to Mahazioth, his sons and his brothers, twelve;
\v 31 for the twenty-fourth to Romamti-Ezer, his sons and his brothers, twelve.
\c 26  
\p
\v 1 For the divisions of the doorkeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.
\v 2 Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
\v 3 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, and Eliehoenai the seventh.
\v 4 Obed-Edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth,
\v 5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him.
\v 6 Sons were also born to Shemaiah his son, who ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor.
\v 7 The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose brothers were valiant men, Elihu, and Semachiah.
\v 8 All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom: they and their sons and their brothers, able men in strength for the service;
sixty-two of Obed-Edom. 
\v 9 Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, valiant men, eighteen. 
\v 10 Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father
made him chief), 
\v 11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.
\v 12 Of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brothers, to minister in
Yahweh’s house. 
\v 13 They cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to their fathers’ houses, for every gate.
\v 14 The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out
northward. 
\v 15 To Obed-Edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse. 
\v 16 To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watchman opposite watchman.
\v 17 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two and two.
\v 18 For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.
\v 19 These were the divisions of the doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.
\p
\v 20 Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of God’s house and over the treasures of the dedicated things.
\v 21 The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers’ households belonging to
Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli. 
\v 22 The sons of Jehieli: Zetham, and Joel his brother, over the treasures of Yahweh’s house.
\v 23 Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites:
\v 24 and Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasures.
\v 25 His brothers: of Eliezer, Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth
his son. 
\v 26 This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the heads
of the fathers’ households, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated.
\v 27 They dedicated some of the plunder won in battles to repair Yahweh’s house.
\v 28 All that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated,
whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth, and of his brothers.
\v 29 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.
\v 30 Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor, one thousand seven hundred, had the oversight of Israel
beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Yahweh, and for the service of the king.
\v 31 Of the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even of the Hebronites, according to their generations by fathers’ households.
They were sought for in the fortieth year of the reign of David, and mighty men of valor were found among them at Jazer of
Gilead. 
\v 32 His brothers, men of valor, were two thousand seven hundred, heads of fathers’ households, whom king David made overseers
over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God, and for the affairs
of the king. 
\c 27  
\p
\v 1 Now the children of Israel after their number, the heads of fathers’ households and the captains of thousands and of
hundreds, and their officers who served the king, in any matter of the divisions which came in and went out month by month
throughout all the months of the year—of every division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 2 Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his division were twenty-four
thousand. 
\v 3 He was of the children of Perez, the chief of all the captains of the army for the first month.
\v 4 Over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite, and his division; and Mikloth the ruler: and in his division
were twenty-four thousand. 
\v 5 The third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, chief: and in his division
were twenty-four thousand. 
\v 6 This is that Benaiah who was the mighty man of the thirty, and over the thirty: and of his division was Ammizabad his son.
\v 7 The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his
division were twenty-four thousand. 
\v 8 The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 9 The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his division were twenty-four
thousand. 
\v 10 The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his division were
twenty-four thousand. 
\v 11 The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zerahites: and in his division were
twenty-four thousand. 
\v 12 The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjamites: and in his division were
twenty-four thousand. 
\v 13 The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zerahites: and in his division were
Twenty-four thousand. 
\v 14 The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his division
were twenty-four thousand. 
\v 15 The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his division were twenty-four
thousand. 
\v 16 Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri the ruler; of the Simeonites,
Shephatiah the son of Maacah; 
\v 17 of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; of Aaron, Zadok; 
\v 18 of Judah, Elihu, one of the brothers of David; of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael;
\v 19 of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah; of Naphtali, Jeremoth the son of Azriel;
\v 20 of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah; of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah;
\v 21 of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah; of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner;
\v 22 of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel.
\v 23 But David didn’t take the number of them from twenty years old and under, because Yahweh had said he would increase
Israel like the stars of the sky. 
\v 24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to take a census, but didn’t finish; and wrath came on Israel for this. The number wasn’t
put into the account in the chronicles of king David. 
\p
\v 25 Over the king’s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, and in the
villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah; 
\v 26 Over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub;
\v 27 and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite; and over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi
the Shiphmite; 
\v 28 and over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowland was Baal Hanan the Gederite; and over the
cellars of oil was Joash; 
\v 29 and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite; and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat
the son of Adlai; 
\v 30 and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite; and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite; and over the flocks was
Jaziz the Hagrite. 
\v 31 All these were the rulers of the property which was king David’s.
\p
\v 32 Also Jonathan, David’s uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was
with the king’s sons. 
\v 33 Ahithophel was the king’s counselor: and Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend.
\v 34 After Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. Joab was the captain of the king’s army.
\c 28  
\p
\v 1 David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, the captains of the companies who served the king by
division, the captains of thousands, the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the
king and of his sons, with the officers and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, “Hear me, my brothers, and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to
build a house of rest for the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building.
\v 3 But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.’
\v 4 However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has
chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure
in me to make me king over all Israel. 
\v 5 Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh’s kingdom
over Israel. 
\v 6 He said to me, ‘Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be
his father. 
\v 7 I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as it is today.’
\p
\v 8 Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, Yahweh’s assembly, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the
commandments of Yahweh your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after
you forever. 
\v 9 You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh
searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you
forsake him, he will cast you off forever. 
\v 10 Take heed now; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.”
\p
\v 11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the plans for the porch of the temple, for its houses, for its treasuries, for its
upper rooms, for its inner rooms, for the place of the mercy seat;
\v 12 and the plans of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of Yahweh’s house, for all the surrounding rooms, for the
treasuries of God’s house, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;
\v 13 also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of Yahweh’s house, and for all the
vessels of service in Yahweh’s house; 
\v 14 of gold by weight for the gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; for all the vessels of silver by weight, for
all vessels of every kind of service; 
\v 15 by weight also for the lamp stands of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps;
and for the lamp stands of silver, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps, according to the use of every lamp stand;
\v 16 and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;
\v 17 and the forks, the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the
silver bowls by weight for every bowl; 
\v 18 and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the plans for the chariot, and the cherubim that spread
out and cover the ark of Yahweh’s covenant. 
\v 19 “All this”, said David, “I have been made to understand in writing from Yahweh’s hand, even all the works of this
pattern.” 
\p
\v 20 David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed; for Yahweh God,
even my God, is with you. He will not fail you, nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of Yahweh’s house is
finished. 
\v 21 Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of God’s house. Every willing man who
has skill, for any kind of service, shall be with you in all kinds of work. Also the captains and all the people will be
entirely at your command.” 
\c 29  
\p
\v 1 David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work
is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God. 
\v 2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things
of silver, the brass for the things of brass, iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; also onyx stones,
stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
\v 3 In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver,
I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
\v 4 even three thousand talents of gold,\f + A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces, so 3000 talents
is about 90 metric tons\f* of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand
talents\f + about 21 metric tons\f* of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses;
\v 5 of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands
of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself today to Yahweh?”
\p
\v 6 Then the princes of the fathers’ households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of
hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly;
\v 7 and they gave for the service of God’s house of gold five thousand
talents\f + A talent is about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds or 965 Troy ounces, so 5000 talents is about 150 metric
tons\f* and ten thousand darics,\f + a daric was a gold coin issued by a Persian king, weighing about 8.4 grams or about 0.27
troy ounces each.\f* of silver ten thousand talents, of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred thousand
talents. 
\v 8 People with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of Yahweh’s house, under the hand of Jehiel the
Gershonite. 
\v 9 Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh;
and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. 
\v 10 Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, “You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of Israel our
father, forever and ever. 
\v 11 Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the heavens and
in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all.
\v 12 Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all! In your hand is power and might! It is in your hand to make
great, and to give strength to all! 
\v 13 Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.
\v 14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you,
and of your own have we given you. 
\v 15 For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and
there is no remaining. 
\v 16 Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is
all your own. 
\v 17 I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart
I have willingly offered all these things. Now I have seen with joy your people, who are present here, offer willingly to you.
\v 18 Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the heart
of your people, and prepare their heart for you; 
\v 19 and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all
these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.”
\p
\v 20 Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless Yahweh your God!”
\p All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before
Yahweh and the king. 
\v 21 They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that day, even one
thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all
Israel, 
\v 22 and ate and drank before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time,
and anointed him before Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.
\p
\v 23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
\v 24 All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.
\v 25 Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and gave to him such royal majesty as had not been on
any king before him in Israel. 
\v 26 Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
\v 27 The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years
in Jerusalem. 
\v 28 He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.
\v 29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the
history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,
\v 30 with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the
countries.
